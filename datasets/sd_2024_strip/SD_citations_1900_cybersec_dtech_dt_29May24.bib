This chapter focuses on a specific domain where the application of blockchain technology has significant potential as an essential facilitator of change, namely: agriculture and the food supply chain. A wide range of relevant recently finished or on-going projects and initiatives are introduced, noting relevant barriers, challenges, potential benefits, and opportunities, addressing the question of whether blockchain has matured enough as a technology to be effectively used in real-life applications within the agri-food industry. Our findings suggest the use of blockchain as a driver toward a transparent food supply chain, yet numerous barriers still exist, which hinder its broader adoption in agri-food systems. The outstanding barriers involve technical, policy, regulatory and educational issues.}

abstract = {While efforts to use digital solutions in process operations are gaining wider acceptance, there are serious safety concerns that need to be addressed when adopting digitalization. Process operations have evolved from batch operation to continuous operation, and from smaller plants to large-scale plants. Automation and digitalization of processes, especially in process monitoring, instrumentation, and control are becoming the norm. Safety issues have also evolved with these developments, from simple equipment failure to failure of process systems (equipment with electronic systems), monitoring and control systems, data encryption systems, and most recently, software systems. How these evolving process safety issues should be taught in the classroom to educate and train the next generation of chemical engineers is a challenge with an opportunity. If such issues are not taught in academia, this will create a gap between education and practice, which would have a negative impact on the overall safety of process facilities. Therefore, proactively converting this challenge to an educational opportunity and bringing digital process safety issues into the classroom are of paramount importance to help reinforce the concept of making process safety learning a conscious choice. This will hopefully lessen our reliance on learning from accidents. The current paper presents the need to incorporate digital process safety as part of the chemical engineering curriculum to adequately address the process industry’s emphasis on digital solutions in process operations.}

Digitization and convergence of information technology (IT) with operational technology (OT) becomes increasingly important. Therefore, enabling innovations, lowering costs, increasing safety systems, enhancing performance, and increasing flexibility gains. In this scenario, opportunities arise for Augmented Reality (AR) capabilities to enhance maintenance operations of digitized trains. Initial research and tests have enabled training technicians and assistance of train drivers during specific activities by facilitating interactions with machines that go beyond traditional training manuals. Despite the positive results AR has shown, there are no specific indications available regarding the ‘deployability’ of the technology related to maintenance tasks. This position paper presents arguable boundaries and challenges for a structural appraisal of AR on maintenance operations of IT/OT converged trains. Potential AR solutions and specifications were based on current maintenance operations. Semi-structured interviews and surveys were conducted with maintenance providers to determine existing challenges. Moreover, the paper comprises an analysis to reveal the potential application AR has in maintenance procedures of digitized trains. Finally, this paper provides future research directions of AR technologies related to maintenance procedures of trains.}

The supplier’s selection, considering the industry 4.0 requirements, is essential in promoting collaborative strategies between suppliers and manufacturers. In this context, this study presents a systematic literature review about quantitative models to support supplier selection in the industry 4.0 era. Fourteen studies were reviewed and characterized in different perspectives such as modelling, application, and validation of the decision model. The results revealed that most of the decision models were developed combining multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Among the criteria related to the Industry 4.0 environment, the most frequent ones were information sharing, technological capacity, digital collaboration and engagement. The gathered results can be useful to guide researchers and managers in the development of computational tools to assist decision-making processes for supplier selection in Industry 4.0 era.}

There is an increase adoption of mobile technology in developing countries amidst numerous infrastructures, technology, and resource-related challenges. Mobile technology is increasingly used for healthcare service delivery and information flow in these countries which is interestingly used to address issues which were previously not possible due to limited access. It is worthwhile noting that most of the use cases in the Asian context are mHealth applications in community setting including that of Sri Lanka which is given primary focus in this chapter. Mobile data collection enhances speed of data transmission from point of capture to the stakeholders who make use of data. Field health worker is empowered with power of information at fingertips and essentially provides a better social status to a less-highlighted role in society. This further enables the clients to receive a better-quality service from field health workers with inputs from specialists and better feedback from all stakeholders involved in the care pathway. However, implementation of mHealth interventions is often encountered with diverse set of challenges in developing countries. Hardware procurement and maintenance are challenging due to financial constraints and poor technical capacity. Abstracting the detailed information on a web interface to the likes of an untrained field health worker using a mobile device has been a challenge in software development perspective in addition to common obstacles inherent to mobile platform such as enabling support for offline data entry and version upgrades. Capacity building, provision of mobile data, and post implementation support are few other major factors affecting the success of a mobile health implementation at community level.}

Digital technology has caused a rethink of the leadership approach in a digital environment that is continuous, dynamic, proactive, and complex, which is driven by phenomena such as globalisation (connectiveness and integration), mass immigration, and multiculturalism. E-privacy requires consent from all parties; how to engage them in the process is a central theme of the paper. Furthermore the type of leadership required is discussed and how it needs to develop in the future, which is identified as the post-General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) era. Last, but not least, is a discussion of the challenges the e-privacy debate presents, such as collective or group e-privacy, and moving from a tick-box approach to GDPR to a recognised global framework that requires commitment from the CEO and the senior management team. Leverage via reputational damage and the power of a regulatory regime could be tools to make businesses commit in spirit to the GDPR framework and view it not just as a penalty for doing business.}

abstract = {The field surveillance of fuel dispensers is an activity of Legal Metrology that checks these measuring instruments' correct behavior. However, it constitutes a complex challenge because malicious entities can tamper with fuel dispensers to get undue economic advantages. This paper proposes a distributed and decentralized solution. We use IoT-based vehicle simple meters to estimate the fuel amount in refilling events. Although these estimates can be inaccurate, we explore properties of the Law of the Large Numbers to evaluate the fuel dispenser's accuracy. We also use blockchains to avoid collusion attacks and provide a truly distributed and decentralized surveillance solution that implements statistical surveillance analysis as smart contracts. We develop a case study based on the vehicular fleet and fuel dispensers in São Paulo, Brazil. We perform our experiment using the Hyperledger Fabric platform with Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus. In a hypothetical scenario where vehicular meters present error rates below 5%, and each vehicle refuels more than ten times on average, we can identify tampered fuel dispensers with sensitivity and specificity over 95%. We also demonstrate that our blockchain deployment can support a workload of 600 concurrent clients with a throughput higher than 350 tps and latency lower than 1 s. These results attest to our framework suitability in terms of accuracy and performance. They provide promising perspectives on using our idea in the metrological surveillance of other measuring instruments.}

Hence, the security administrator needs to dynamically maintain the role assignments to users for optimizing user-role assignments. The manual updation of user-role assignments is prone to error and increases administrative workload. Therefore, a role recommendation model is introduced for the RBAC system to optimize user-role assignments based on user behaviour patterns. It is shown that the model automatically revokes and refurbishes the user-role assignments by observing user access behaviour. This model is used in the cloud for providing Role-Assignment-as-a-Service to optimize the cost of built-in roles. Several experiments are conducted to verify the proposed model using the Amazon access sample dataset. The experimental results show that the efficiency of the proposed model is 50% higher than the state-of-the-art.}

abstract = {This chapter addresses one of the challenging issues in microgrid operation which is their protection. The chapter first introduces what a protection system is in general and what the main requirements for the protection of microgrids are. The differences between the protection of microgrids and a conventional distribution network are also elaborated. The conventional protection schemes and their applicability in microgrids are discussed with a special focus on overcurrent, differential, and distance protections. The relatively new and unseasoned voltage-based and centralized protection schemes are also briefly discussed. Then there is a discussion of advanced approaches such as adaptive protection and machine learning-based methods. The commonly used configurations and impacts of earthing system in the protection of microgrids are also covered in the later stages of the chapter.}

abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has already led to a dramatic loss of human life and has negatively affected the well-being of people, including numerous sectors such as health, work, economy, culture, as well as education. This kind of disruption not only has raised many concerns but it has also forced humans to interdisciplinary collaborations to fast find smart solutions if not an effective therapy and/or successful vaccines. Digital transformation is a main driver toward finding smart solutions often based on artificial intelligence and information communication technologies such as big data analytics and machine learning, combined with mainly the recent advancements in molecular biology, bioinformatics, and pharmacology as well as in areas related to health-care policies. This chapter examines ways of empowering the One Health approach and health resilience with digital technologies across Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries using as a case study the COVID-19 pandemic. It also offers smart solutions and a framework on digital technologies that strengthen health systems, as illustrated by the fast deployment of various digital tools and resilient solutions that have allowed countries to better detect and prevent the spread of the disease and to effectively respond to the pandemic.}

The broad use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in manufacturing forms the concept of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), connecting physical and digital systems and integrating value chains. Although with different approaches, LM and I4.0 share the same goals of increasing flexibility and productivity. In fact, two views on their interaction can be extracted from literature: LM serves as a basis for I4.0 and I4.0 improves LM effectiveness. The novelties presented by I4.0 comprise not only the technical scope, but also the behavioral one. It has been unclear, however, how I4.0 affects LM soft practices, especially when it comes to the skills required for Lean professionals to face this new environment. In this regard, this paper addresses the impact of I4.0 on the skills of Lean professionals. One could observe that in addition to technical skills linked to programming and data science, analytical and interpersonal skills make up the sociocultural skills necessary for the professional of the future in the context of I4.0.}

Also, access control strategies and mechanisms are required to be embedded with data sharing to prevent manipulation and breeching of patient’s sensitive data and maintain its confidentiality and integrity. Blockchain technology can be a solution to the vulnerabilities associated with data sharing and data manipulation. In this chapter, we discuss the scope, applicability, and usage of blockchain technology to preserve the sensitive medical data of patients. A framework is also proposed which allows patients and hospitals to store medical records. The framework allows patients to share it by providing access to its own data and to invoke smart contract for automatic payments for their medical claims.}

Cyber-risks are one of these potential setbacks, affecting supply chains directly and indirectly, and propagating via supply chain flows and stocks – information, material, and financial. This study applied a systematic literature review to determine how the supply chain’s flows and stocks serve as points of entry to cyber-risks. Cyber-risks arise from different sources (i.e., direct attacks, built-in problems, low-quality issues), impacting supply chains’ flows and stocks (material and information). There is a relation between the type of supply chain and which flow, or stock facilitates access to the supply chain. Finally, we provide a distinction between two concepts related to Supply Chain Risk Management and cyber-risks. This research is useful to 1) enterprise decision-makers, as the description of potential cyber-risks’ points of entry delivers hints on where to focus managerial efforts; 2) developers of Supply Chain Management (SCM) Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems, since discussing potential points of entry build awareness about probable exploitation points, thus improving ICT systems’ resiliency, and 3) scholars, as the depiction of the state-of-the-art may serve as a common departing point for future research.}

However, these offerings seldom enhance revenue, because companies struggle with business model (BM) dynamics. By analyzing 27 companies through an explorative case-study approach, the authors consider how companies can successfully achieve revenue enhancement through digital offerings. The result is a threefold framework for revenue enhancement through digital offerings. First, this framework distinguishes between three phases of BM dynamics: 1) augmenting products through a “hardware plus” logic, 2) developing a portfolio of multiple logics for creating customer value, 3) integrating this portfolio through platform logic. Second, the framework emphasizes that three barriers, which we refer to as confidence, mixing, and collaboration barrier, limit the progress from Phases 1 to 3. Third, the framework reveals that each phase contains certain modifications of BM components. In the first phase, companies adapt their BM components slightly, so as to advance toward a “hardware plus” logic. In the second phase, companies embrace more radical BM innovations in order to convert services into an outcome-based BM and develop a new software subscription BM. In the third phase, companies modify BM components in order to integrate the BMs internally and to open them up for external collaboration partners.}

However, there has not been much comprehensive analysis on how pandemics shape urban societies, yet more than half of the human population now lives in cities. This paper attests to the question of whether pandemics disrupt or seed transformations in cities. The paper draws on a qualitative systematic review of academic literature, using Black Death in the middle ages of European societies as the mark to the advent of COVID-19 in metropolitan China. The evidence reveals that drastic disease-control measures and unprecedented restrictions on urban mobility, not only interrupt stable and coherent meanings of urban life but also negate the notion of carefully planned transformations. The analysis highline is that pandemic-induced transformations often come with conundrums within economic sectors, cyber security, public health and civil liberties, which makes the semblance of disruptive transformations appear inevitable. The evidence shows that pandemics often seed transformations in cities through fluid contexts of emergent changes in governance and urban design. Although mathematical and computer simulations predominantly guide decision-making on containment and recovery from pandemics, the evidence indicates that such data accounts for only a fraction of the information needed to confront the risks faced by cities. The paper recommends that efforts around recovery and containment of pandemics, need to be rooted in a culture of transdisciplinarity, which calls for stronger contributions from and collaborations amongst different tribes of science and sectors of governments.}

Forecasting what constitutes a disruptive technology for the agri-food industry is complicated as the impact is more likely to be measured from a retrospective downstream reflective process. DTs can substantially cause localized change within a market or industry (i.e., first-order disruption) and cause ground-breaking changes across many cross-cutting domains (i.e., second-order disruption) over short or more extended time periods that substantially influence societal norms. Modern-day and future food disruption will be influenced by growing demand to produce more safe nutritious food to meet increasing populations that will respond to dynamic changes in eating habits, personalized nutrition, and consumer attitudes toward alternative protein sources and climate change. Exploiting advances in information communications technology and advanced manufacturing (such as the Internet of Things, big data, blockchain, artificial intelligence, robotics, augment and virtual reality, 3D printing) will inform creative disruption such as security, packaging, and enhanced online delivery in the food supply chain that is comprehensively addressed throughout this book. A review of the recent 43 projects funded by the Irish government under Science Foundation Ireland’s Disruptive Technology initiative highlighted trends in the innovation ecosystem and the potential for both cross-cutting and future food disruption with global outreach and orientation.

It argues that while some actors may see an opportunity to distort the truth for profitable gains, new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and satellite imagery can change the economics of truth and bring blockchain closer to a truth machine. Recommendations and implications for policymakers, companies, and scholarly research are discussed.}

Based on the componential theory of creativity, we compare the crowd's and professionals’ creativity, focusing on generalist versus specialist tasks. Leveraging online experiments and semantic analysis, we find that the crowd is more creative than professionals in solving generalist tasks. However, the crowd is less innovative than professionals in solving specialist tasks, thereby suggesting a boundary to crowdsourcing. Nevertheless, to solve specialist tasks, members of the crowd can gain relevant knowledge by exposing themselves to each other's ideas, thereby suggesting an attempt to break the boundary. This study offers new insights into the boundary of crowdsourcing for innovation.}

Primarily, this is driven by megatrends, such as smart factories, which include interconnected machines and human-robot interaction.

On the other hand, however, it drives the demand for the safety and security of the systems, as the potential of harm to human beings is increased in such collaborative scenarios. Therefore, in the case of a cobot, increased awareness of cyber security aspects and their relations to the system’s safety is advisable.

We argue that focusing on different core values, these three major actors are the key driving forces shaping China's data protection regime. Their dynamic and multidimensional power relations have been casting the development of China's data protection law with various uncertainties. When persuing different, yet not always conflicting values, these three major actors may both cooperate and compete with each other. Based on our careful analysis of the shifting power relations, we identify and assess three possible paths of the development of China's data protection law. We are much concerned that the proposed comprehensive data protection law might be a new attempt of the State to win legitimacy abroad, while actually trying to reinforce massive surveillance besides economic goals. We argue that a modest alternative may be that this law might show some genuine efforts for protecting data privacy, but still with poor enforcement. Last, we argue that the most desirable development would be that this law could provide basic but meaningful and effective protection for data privacy, and lay a good foundation for further development.}

They are part of the risk that beset organizations as they innovate and derive value from their information technology (IT) investments. IT assets that must be identified and safeguarded, and values extracted from them are contributors to the risk. Literature is awash with models of threats to assets and use of mid-range theories. There is a growing literature on digital technologies within digital transformation. However, intrinsic nature and epistemic uncertainty of IT assets have not received attention. Therefore, how can a conceptual definition for IT assets flow from understanding their nature, given their inherent epistemic uncertainty? Drawing from critical realism principles, this paper investigates existing definitions for- and re-interrogates the tangible nature (tangibility) of IT assets. It was found that despite their ubiquity and due to their evolving nature, IT assets lack universal understanding and definition. Executives (and professionals) views about IT assets are informed by their industry sector and role (present and/or previous). Consequently, this paper recommends a conceptual definition of IT assets that would assist; with coherence in the asset identification stage of risk assessment, (possibly IT audits and IT valuation programs), with understanding of the intrinsic nature of IT assets in themselves, and aid organizations in holistically engaging with IT assets. This paper's IT assets definition contributes to the call for theorizing the “IT” in IT. It poses new probing questions about ‘old’, ‘established’ beliefs as IT assets evolve in the era of digital transformation, fourth industrial revolution, knowledge economy and beyond.}

These investments are particularly important as an attempt to close digital divides among countries and regions within countries. However, there is no clear evidence that suggests that current Information and Communication Technology (ICT) policies are helping align investments with the actual needs of the local contexts. Based on data about the allocation of 2014–2020 EU Funds, this paper analyzes the relationship between local needs and investment decisions aiming at bridging territorial digital divides. The results identify four different regional strategies developed around four policy goals: broadband, digital inclusion, digital government services, and the use of ICTs in enterprises. The results also show that unlike the past 2007–13 period, the allocations to these goals appear to be consistent with the ICT local context, i.e. funding for a given goal is higher in the regions that need it the most. Therefore, our main recommendation for the European Commission and Member States is to keep existing requirements for developing evidence-informed “Digital Growth” strategies for the next 2021–27 period. We also suggest to strengthen existing support tools for regional governments.}

The feasibility of the proposed approach is illustrated with an example from the commissioning phase of a building, which includes an autonomous robotic system to collect data as a possible countermeasure. The suggested countermeasure shows promise to address some of the cybersecurity challenges faced in the building certification and commissioning process. The results show that the likelihood of detecting rogue sensors increases with additional constraints in the monitoring robot, such as minimum and maximum distance. The illustrative models suggest that the proposed framework will help to address the safety and cyber security of stakeholders and systems during crucial phases of construction projects.}

In this era, where the data are a very sensitive commodity, an attack or data loss can mean losing user trust. Various researchers have dealt precisely with these ideas. They figured out several effective methods of preventing data loss and how to reduce attack amount either on a database or on a web site. Big data, which currently has a significant role in many statistics, are susceptible to various data losses, steal, or deletion. Possible data deletion can lead to a wrong decision about a transport situation prediction task, inaccurate result in decision support, or even to lousy diagnosis prediction in medicine. This vast amount of the problems led to the significant data amount and their security problem solution. Our article relates to data security in situations with substantial real data amount in time, which are entering the system. We suggest effective data distribution methods and a mechanism for data transfer from a database to data storage according to individual records’ time parameters.}

On account of generators dynamics and static power flows, a descriptor system model for power systems is firstly established. Then, a necessary and sufficient condition for perfect attack is given in terms of unstable eigenvector by the eigen-decomposition of system matrices. Based on this, a false data injection attack scheme, which can pass not only the observer detection but also the measurement limit detection, is presented to destabilize the power systems. The proposed scheme has the advantages of concealment and implementation simplicity when compared to the existing static attack counterpart. Additionally, the obtained results can help to understand the weakness of power systems and establish some more secure protective measures. Simulations on the IEEE 9 - bus and 14 - bus power systems demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method.}

abstract = {The goal of industrial revolutions is not only to improve and respond directly to the needs of industry in a productive side fact, but also to improve the standard of living of society and make life easier for customers. Therefore, economic growth should always go hand in hand with each industrial revolution. In this context, the increasing demand for electricity, the non-renewable nature of conventional sources and the rising price of fuel, are considered the constraints of the 21st century and need to be definitively managed in order to meet the constantly increasing demand for electricity from the population in the best possible conditions. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are the foundation on which tomorrow’s innovative solutions are created. However, smart embedded systems and the internet are two major players driving ICT technologies forward. These technologies have impacted several sectors, where we find a crossroads of several industrial sectors: medical, manufacturing, automation, energy and others. The application these technologies in a smart grid framework with the integration of renewable energy sources and used for an optimization and efficiency mission let Internet of Things (IoT) to take the sustainable and industrial character and named Green Industrial Internet of Things (GIIoT). This last, seems to be a promoting axis for the development of future applications. In this paper, we present an overview of the impact of the Internet of Things on the evolution of applications in relation to the different revolutions, an inventory of the different industrial revolutions, an overview of the GIIoT as well as some applications and perspectives.}

abstract = {Advanced manufacturing and 3D printing are transformative technologies currently undergoing rapid adoption in healthcare, a traditionally non-manufacturing sector. Recent development in this field, largely enabled by merging different disciplines, has led to important clinical applications from anatomical models to regenerative bioscaffolding and devices. Although much research to-date has focussed on materials, designs, processes, and products, little attention has been given to the design and requirements of facilities for enabling clinically relevant biofabrication solutions. These facilities are critical to overcoming the major hurdles to clinical translation, including solving important issues such as reproducibility, quality control, regulations, and commercialization. To improve process uniformity and ensure consistent development and production, large-scale manufacturing of engineered tissues and organs will require standardized facilities, equipment, qualification processes, automation, and information systems. This review presents current and forward-thinking guidelines to help design biofabrication laboratories engaged in engineering model and tissue constructs for therapeutic and non-therapeutic applications.}

author = {Christian Pauletto},
abstract = {Purpose
Recognition of foreign qualifications for authorising the exercise of a regulated profession gains importance in globalised economies and in international organisations such as the UNESCO. However, national procedures for such recognition have not yet experienced the transformative changes that occurred in other sectors of public administration. The study of “transborder digitisation” is still in its infancy. While governments consider the adoption of blockchain applications for the e-administration of trade-related procedures, for example customs procedures, it is timely to give some thoughts to recognition as well.
Aims
After explaining the role of recognition in international relations this article explores the features of recognition procedures that are relevant for the choice of a technology. It then aims to identify recognition authorities’ needs in terms of administrative tools and to find out the options and potential benefits of blockchain technology in view of those needs. It aims to find whether there are reasons to select that particular technology rather than conventional methods. This is highlighted in a concrete description of what could be a possible configuration of a blockchain solution for recognition procedures. Since opportunities are always balanced by limitations, the article also inquires into ithe expected challenges in adopting a blockchain system between different countries’ recognition authorities. The article’s overall aim is to offer an assessment of blockchain technologies’ potential in that field and to highlight developments in technology that could ease their adoption.
Findings
The article finds that the advantages brought by DLT technologies and the needed features of recognition processes coincide in several respects. However, some critical challenges and limitations for the application of blockchain in this field also exist. An adoption of that technology for that particular branch of public administration could occur provided that the technology continues to improve. Such improvements include interoperability, interface with other protocols and legacy databases, portability, and a higher degree of safety regarding privacy.}

Mostly due to Texas’ contribution, the United States has become a net exporter of oil, reversing a 70-year trend since the Arab Embargo of 1973. The reversal is due mostly to the development of hydraulic fracturing technology primarily from the Permian Basin formation in West Texas. Deregulation of the electric utility industry has unleashed a flurry of institutional, market, and technological innovation. Texas and the United States are major leaders in spreading innovation around the world. Fundamental to the creation of shared innovation outcomes is the process that generates ideas under the banner of freedom in this capitalistic democracy.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to facilitate blockchain innovation immersion in accountancy organizations by providing tools that allow organizations to manage the change. The paper approaches blockchain technology (BT) through the lens of organizational change management, with a specific focus at the organization level.
Design/methodology/approach
A hybrid systematic literature review of relevant literature is presented based on recent research papers published in highly ranked scientific journals that capture how accounting organizations might manage the changes induced by BT.
Findings
The findings of the review indicate that implementing BT requires some new modus operandi. From individual behavior to organizational structure, the advantages of blockchain must be emphasized in all accounting and auditing organizations. Managers should forge a plan that takes advantage of employees' skills, competencies and talent, implementing forward-looking company procedures and actively deciding how to navigate workplace dynamics, personalities and responsibilities.
Research limitations/implications
The main limitations of the study refer to the infancy of the BT and require the development of knowledge through future studies to allow a more accurate outline of the overall picture and a detailed one of the BT phenomena with applicability to accounting and auditing. At this stage, it is not yet possible to fully envision the implications of BT on professional accounting and auditing organizations. However, there will be clients who adopt BTs, so firms should work with them to understand BT-based accounting and auditing applications. That is, accounting and auditing organizations should expand their skills and knowledge to anticipate and meet clients' needs.
Practical implications
In a constantly digitalizing world, the traditional accounting and educational environment is changing but not quickly enough to meet the requirements of a blockchain accounting system yet. For this reason, practical implications on the daily activities of the organizations and the restructuration of their internal architecture have been revealed in this paper.
Originality/value
The paper approaches blockchain using the lens of organizational change management with a specific focus on the accounting and audit organizations, and it proposes solutions to cope with the arising technological challenges. A challenge itself is the implementation of blockchain, especially when an entity is not ready for the process. Therefore, the SWOT analysis elaborated in this paper and focused on the accounting and auditing firms is an element of novelty and at the same time, a helpful tool highlighting the main strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of this technology, supporting organizations in assessing how ready they are for its adoption. The research on blockchain in accountancy organizations is still necessary for at least seven key areas which have been proposed and detailed at the end of the paper, bringing in this way clarity in regards to the most endorsed avenues for future research directions.}

However, such trust can be eroded in many different ways (e.g., unauthorized data modifications). Several privacy-preservation schemes have been designed for specific data and/or require strict assumptions (e.g., a private/secure communication channel between client-server and third-party authentication). However, these may limit their application in practice. Hence, in this paper we propose the Reversible Data Transform (RDT) algorithm based privacy-preserving data collection protocol. Our protocol allows us to achieve privacy preservation against beyond the scope processing and does not require a private channel or rely on a third-party authentication. Due to group formation, the disclosure probability of the internal disclosure attack will not be greater than 1/k. Similarly, the reversible privacy-preserving data mining approach protects beyond the scope processing. Findings from the experimentation demonstrates the utility of the proposed protocol and its potential to be deployed in a mobile app recommendation system.}

This empirical study utilises primary data from a descriptive survey of supply chain practitioners working across a range of industry sectors and different stages in the supply chain. Whilst the findings from this research indicate that some Industry 4.0 technologies are still in the early stages of adoption, amongst Australian supply chain organisations, they clearly show which technologies are anticipated to have the greatest impact, what sectors that impact will most likely occur in, and which specific improvements they are expected to drive. Larger firms were found to be more digitally-ready than smaller firms, and a number of significant gaps were identified between expected impact and expected investment, meaning little spend is currently projected for certain technologies that are expected to have a significant impact.}

Among the innovations are neuroprosthetic devices such as adaptive deep brain stimulation systems that detect brain states and adjust stimulation of the brain according to those states, and mind-controlled robotic limbs. These systems blur the boundaries between the body and mind of the person and the hardware and software of the device. In addition, the device represents a novel point of access to the body and mind of the person, with the collection of streams of neural data otherwise generally inaccessible and a potential route—if networked—for inadvertent disruption or malicious hacking. These developments raise questions about how existing laws apply to these devices and whether the laws need to be modified. In this chapter, we explore what legal resources are available to address some of the possible legal claims arising from their use, and what the systematic legal logic underlying the resolution of such claims might be. In order to do this we propose a map of the fundamental interests users may have in these technologies, and a legal ontology or categories the law would use to frame these interests. Providing examples from how the law has sought to solve similar problems, the chapter contributes to policy-making efforts, concluding that a key is to be found in the plasticity of the law itself.}

Our best understanding of the innovation process is informed by past experience generated by capitalistic democracies, especially that of the United States. The Texas experience with energy sector innovation has taken the state through stages of innovation from the market-driven events led by strong individuals that began with the oil sector to a much more complex market, policy, and technology combination a 100 years later. The last two decades have produced electric sector deregulation, wind farm development and the phenomenal hydraulic fracturing innovation. If market disruption is a major source of the next round of beneficial innovation of markets, institutions, and technology, then the fracking revolution among all of the innovation experiences summarized in this book leads the way to a better future. The struggle to deal with the aftermath of the Arab Embargo of 1973 and the following Iranian Crisis of 1979 was the disruption that opened the way to serious secondary and tertiary oil and gas recovery, the end to natural gas well head price controls, wind resource development, electric industry restructuring, and fracking of oil and gas reservoirs. These are the big events—there are others. So, it seems fundamental that we must keep the idea generator going and certainly maintain the freedom of individuals and democratic groups of individuals to form processes and funding of the idea generators with stability beyond the next election.}

abstract = {The issue of public health has been an essential part of the concept of sustainable development for a number of years, which is reflected, among others, in the EU strategic documents. The implementation of programs to improve health and quality of life as well as ensuring the stability or efficiency of health care systems is currently supported by various types of digital technologies. The so-called e-health systems have come into being and are becoming more and more popular. The COVID-19 pandemic has additionally highlighted an inevitable need for the development of innovative manners and tools to increase access to health care which use a variety of ICT-based solutions. Therefore, the objective of the article is an attempt to respond to the question about the attitudes of patients and doctors to the so-called e-health systems, and in particular, to what extent they trust them. The authors used critical review of relevant literature and in-depth interviews to carry out the research in private health care units located in Szczecin. The survey covered two groups of patients and doctors of the above-mentioned units. The conducted research has indicated that although the surveyed patients and doctors use digital e-health systems and are positive about them, the level of trust in selected technologies varies. The conclusions of the conducted analyses confirm that the challenges underlying the digitization and popularization of e-health systems are not only technical since they are rooted and linked to the need to create a high level of trust in such systems, which is the foundation for the ethical and effective use of new digital tools in the context of increased awareness and the more active role of patients in the treatment process. Therefore, there is a need to take specific actions aimed at increasing the level of trust in digital technologies used in selected areas by both doctors and patients, which is the condition for the popularization of innovative services provided under e-health systems.}

Therefore, the ability to map the potential of scattered and diverse digital knowledge sources automatically and quickly is urgent for identifying critical knowledge so that organizations can effectively carry out knowledge management. This research is a finalization of the initial smart knowledge mapping model to fit out the limited scope of validation studied previously; this was done by conducting a mix-method approach methodology to examine validation using interviews, forum group discussions (FGD) and questionnaires. The results of our questionnaire validation were analyzed using the Fuzzy Delphi Method to determine the level of agreement between the experts. This study proposed conceptual model smart knowledge mapping, which consists of eleven components: leadership, IT infrastructure, environment, objective, stakeholder, business process, KM process, valuable digital activity, knowledge resource, advanced computing and KMap content. This study also proposed a process and activity combination quadrant to determine the availability of knowledge resources for implementation of this model.}

abstract = {Recently, a lot of studies have been conducted on what factors and strategies affect the successful implementation of e-government programs around the world. Most of these studies lack a clear plan for selecting strategies and setting their priorities for implementation and thus ensuring the success of such programs. In a previous study conducted by the same researchers, these strategies and their implementation priorities were defined based on the opinions of 20 government experts who were interviewed and asked to rank the strategies based on 23 factors resulting from the SWOT analysis that summarizes the context under study, specifically Jordan as an example of a developing country. However, there is a problem that still exists facing many of these countries, which is the divergence of opinions of government decision-makers in ranking their priorities for implementing various government strategies, including e-government programs, and thus affecting the quality of the strategic decision taken. Therefore, this study will address the problem by finding a new methodology that enables to obtain a stable ranking of strategies in order to make the best strategic decision to implement the e-government program in the context under study or other similar contexts in the region. This study assumes that we can obtain a stable ranking of strategies related to implementing e-government programs when we only use the SWOT factors that produce stable ranking votes. To validate this, three main experiments with a number of proposed scenarios were developed to aggregate expert rankings on the implementation of e-government strategies using some common vote ranking methods, namely, parametric methods such as Borda, Copeland and Maximin, and algorithmic methods such as Stuart and Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA). Then, to evaluate the results of the three experimental scenarios, two new measures were proposed, namely the Similarity Index measure and the Matching Index measure. The results confirmed the validity of the assumption regarding the importance of obtaining a stable vote ranking in selecting the best strategies to ensure success in implementing e-government program in the context under study or other similar contexts in the region.}

Industry 4.0 has emerged in sustainable supply chain systems, blockchain is prominent, with the potential of immutable transparent data. Blockchains present potential to disrupt supply chains through digital transformation by enabling provenance, visibility, relationships, collaboration, lower costs, and enabling real-time trusted data. Scholars are increasingly investigating blockchain adoption, with an emphasis on technology acceptance modelling. Current research is valuable to understand potentials of blockchain technology in supply chains however, there is limited work on the building blocks for blockchain adoption in digital transformation of supply chains. This study aims to investigate through a systematic literature review and case studies, the building blocks for blockchain adoption in digital transformation of sustainable supply chains. Blockchain adoption in supply chain management is receiving increasing attention, along with highlights of critical factors. This paper offers a building block model that is in three main phases; pre-adoption, adoption, and the post adoption. The model indicates that adoption context, blockchain technology platform offerings, strategic responses, and adoption readiness are some key building blocks, particularly at the pre-adoption phase. Trust and supply chain network, firm resources, and blockchain costs are all considered critical in the considerations of the building blocks. In addition, aligning supply chain objectives with blockchain systems is critical and so is blockchain compatibility. Law and governance are amongst the two prominent challenges in blockchain adoption and should be considered as part of the building blocks for blockchain adoption.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology with an increasing popularity and applications in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. Although many of these areas closely relate to the urban context, there is limited understanding of the trending AI technologies and their application areas—or concepts—in the urban planning and development fields. Similarly, there is a knowledge gap in how the public perceives AI technologies, their application areas, and the AI-related policies and practices of our cities. This study aims to advance our understanding of the relationship between the key AI technologies (n = 15) and their key application areas (n = 16) in urban planning and development. To this end, this study examines public perceptions of how AI technologies and their application areas in urban planning and development are perceived and utilized in the testbed case study of Australian states and territories. The methodological approach of this study employs the social media analytics method, and conducts sentiment and content analyses of location-based Twitter messages (n = 11,236) from Australia. The results disclose that: (a) digital transformation, innovation, and sustainability are the most popular AI application areas in urban planning and development; (b) drones, automation, robotics, and big data are the most popular AI technologies utilized in urban planning and development, and; (c) achieving the digital transformation and sustainability of cities through the use of AI technologies—such as big data, automation and robotics—is the central community discussion topic.}

The rapid technological advancements enhance the smartness of these CPSs, pushing their boundaries of performance and efficiency by embedding new information and communication technologies. However, to what extent CPSs should be smarter so that they do not compromise safety and security of safety critical systems? is an open research question. Towards this goal, the purpose of this study is to establish a grounded theory to analyse what makes these systems smart? and eventually, how to find a balance between smartness and safety risks? In this precinct, this article aims to develop a conceptual framework, define the dimensions and derive the characteristics that make CPSs smart. The proposed approach combines an automated informetric and systematic analysis of literature pertinent to the topic of smartness across anthropology, science, engineering and technology. The analysis of a case study building and the discussions presented herein support the connection between the existing understanding of CPSs and smartness offered by the building design approach in urban environment.}

In such a scenario, social innovations based on ambient assisted living technologies that enable a digital transformation of health care and social care delivery systems can empower older adults to live autonomously in their own neighbourhoods and postpone or even prevent migration to a nursing home. Extension of these innovations in service provision to smart cities is the subject of this paper. The development of smart cities presents opportunities for the development of new, digitally supported health and social infrastructure in urban and rural areas. These innovations will enable a more efficient combination of existing societal resources in neighbourhoods for the provision of health care and social needs to the ageing residents who are dependent on others due to illness or functional decline. On the supply side, new scientific and technological innovations offer new utilities and create new businesses for the supply of goods and services to older people, and provide new job opportunities for younger workers entering the job market. This paper aims to consider the digital transformation of social infrastructure as a part of the development of smart cities to support the autonomy of the elderly population.}

The number of vulnerabilities in industrial facilities is constantly increasing [1]. To implement a cyber defense framework for industrial systems, the cybersecurity standard IEC 62443 has been proposed. This standard mainly provides a set of instructions and measures to be put in place to ensure not only the security of the industrial system, but also operational safety.

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) – the ability of a computer or a robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings – represents both a new challenge and a significant opportunity for the future of space activities. Indeed, increasing connectivity and symbiotic interactions between humans and intelligent machines raise significant questions for the rule of law and contemporary ethics, including the applicable rules relating to liability in case of damage arising from advanced AI. AI also encompasses a series of complex issues that cut across social, economic, public policy, technological, legal, ethical and national security boundaries. The development of AI-based autonomous systems is equally relevant in the context of military operations and on the battlefield, particularly with the use of drones and, more controversially, Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems. After outlining the legal and ethical challenges posed by this technology, this article focuses on AI systems for space operations that give rise to questions about how these interact with existing legal concepts and technical standards. This article also describes how space law is relevant and applicable to AI use in the context of space missions. The specific attributes of autonomous space systems may also require further consideration as to the traditional application of the authorization of space missions, the international responsibility of States and the liability regime in case of damage. As a precursor to more detailed research in the future, this article seeks to introduce some of the more significant legal issues that AI-driven automated processes might pose for space operations.}

They are capable of disrupting and destroying cyber infrastructures, denying organizations access to IT services, and stealing sensitive information including intellectual property, trade secrets and customer data. Past research points to Situation Awareness as critical to effective response. However, most research has focused on the technological perspective with comparatively less focus on the practice perspective. We therefore present an in-depth case study of a leading financial organization with a well-resourced and mature incident response capability that has evolved as a result of experiences with past attacks. Our contribution is a process model that explains how organizations can practice situation awareness of the cyber-threat landscape and the broad business context in incident response.}

This is particularly important since both of these concepts are part of the dynamic capabilities that help in embracing digital innovation at a national level. Relevant data from 28 European countries representing development indicators and ease of doing business over a timeframe of 7 years from 2009 to 2015 were analysed to formulate and investigate a new perspective of digital entrepreneurship driven by the concepts of digital transformation and entrepreneurship. To do this, digital transformation has been broken into three categories, namely technology readiness (e.g. ICT investments), digital technology exploration (e.g. research and development) and digital technology exploitation (e.g. patents and trademarks). This research identifies several significant relationships between such constructs, which contribute to the literature and provide key implications for business management and practitioners.}

Hence In this paper, to resolve such issues, Holistic Big Data Integrated Artificial Intelligent Modeling (HBDIAIM) has been proposed to improve the privacy and security aspects of data management interface in various smart city applications. In HBDIAIM, a differential evolutionary algorithm has been incorporated to build adequate security for the confidential data management interface in smart city applications. Furthermore, the Big Data analytics assisted decision privacy scheme has been used in the differential evolutionary algorithm, which improves the scalability and accessibility of the information in a data management interface based on their corresponding storage location. In addition, the Adaptable interference method is designed and developed to optimize the scalability and privacy issues data management interface of various smart city applications. The simulation analysis is performed based on security, accuracy, performance, and scalability proves the reliability of the proposed framework.}

The literature was systematically searched using English and Chinese electronic databases, and 46 articles published between 2012 and early 2020 were sampled and analyzed. An integrated approach guided the interpretation of the sampled articles with a focus on sociocultural support for the digitalization of early childhood in Mainland China, Chinese teachers' attitudes and competencies for integrating technology into their instructional practices, and the influence of theoretical constructs in framing research questions and findings. The progress, problems, and prospect of digitalizing early childhood are discussed. The findings suggest that Chinese early childhood teachers are not quite ready for optimizing the integration of digital tools into their classrooms, and teacher education may play a critical role in fostering technological competencies and confidence of the next generation of early childhood educators.}

A smart production unit can be thought of as a powerful connected industrial system with materials, parts, equipment, tools, inventory, and logistics that can transmit data and communicate with one another in the age of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This IIoT refers to linked devices, sensors, and other equipment that may be networked in the industrial environment to provide remote access, effective monitoring, better data collecting, analysis, & exchange etc. In Industry 4.0, IIoT is fundamental to transforming cyber-physical systems and production processes through big data and analytics. This paper provides an overview of the IIoT and the technologies that underpin it. The primary benefits and features of IIoT in manufacturing are discussed in detail. Smart Transformations made into the manufacturing field through IIoT Culture are discussed diagrammatically. Finally, twenty-nine significant applications of IIoT in the field of manufacturing are identified and discussed. IIoT can monitor the transport, supply of the goods, consult details on things in warehouses, and check the conditions related to product storage and delivery and allow all dispersed and outsourced operations to be monitored. Therefore, the industry is being revolutionised by IIoT, altering the way industrial enterprises function daily to improve efficiency and performance levels.}
