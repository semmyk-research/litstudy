abstract = {Safety education has found a place in the chemical engineering curriculum. However, its complete impact is yet to be realized. A part of this delay may be attributed to the gap between the concepts traditionally taught in engineering education and the tools required for the practice of engineering in the process industry. This gulf is only exacerbated by the advent of Industry 4.0, which relies heavily on emerging technologies, such as big data, automation, and machine learning. Therefore, a fundamental aspect that educators of process safety need to readdress is the following: “How can safety knowledge and competence among engineering graduates be enhanced for them to have a sustained impact on the safe design and operation of chemical processes during industrial practice?” In this context, the present work investigates the status of safety knowledge development and transfer from education to practice. A detailed analysis of demographic and temporal evaluation of safety education in specific engineering disciplines, and the shortcomings of the current curricula in imparting safety concepts to the students, are also discussed in detail. This perspective attempts to bridge the gap between academic training and the job requirements of process safety engineers through a concept titled ‘Safety Education 4.0’. In the proposed Safety Education 4.0 methodology, academics and industry personnel collaborate in teaching students safety principles through project-based learning (PBL). The compact modular format of PBL makes it flexible to be updatable on-demand process safety education.}

abstract = {Introduction: The construction industry employs about 7% of global manpower and contributes about 6% to the global economy. However, statistics have depicted that the construction industry contributes significantly to workplace fatalities and injuries despite multiple interventions (including technological applications) implemented by governments and construction companies. Recently, immersive technologies as part of a suite of industry 4.0 technologies, have also strongly emerged as a viable pathway to help address poor construction occupational safety and health (OSH) performance. Method: With the aim of gaining a broad view of different construction OSH issues addressed using immersive technologies, a review on the application of immersive technologies for construction OSH management is conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) approach and bibliometric analysis of literature. This resulted in the evaluation of 117 relevant papers collected from three online databases (Scopus, Web of Science, and Engineering Village). Results: The review revealed that literature have focused on the application of various immersive technologies for hazard identification and visualization, safety training, design for safety, risk perception, and assessment in various construction works. The review identified several limitations regarding the use of immersive technologies, which include the low level of adoption of the developed immersive technologies for OSH management by the construction industry, very limited research on the application of immersive technologies for health hazards, and limited focus on the comparison of the effectiveness of various immersive technologies for construction OSH management. Conclusions and Practical Applications: For future research, it is recommended to identify possible reasons for the low transition level from research to industry practice and proffer solutions to the identified issues. Another recommendation is the study of the effectiveness of the use of immersive technologies for addressing health hazards in comparison to the conventional methods.}

Purpose
The American College of Epidemiology held its 2021 Annual Meeting virtually, September 8–10, with a conference theme of ‘From Womb to Tomb: Insights from Health Emergencies’. The American College of Epidemiology Ethics Committee hosted a symposium session in recognition of the ethical and social challenges brought to light by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and on the occasion of the publication of the third edition of the classic text, Ethics and Epidemiology. The American College of Epidemiology Ethics Committee invited the book editor and contributing authors to present at the symposium session titled ‘Current Ethical and Social Issues in Epidemiology.’ The purpose of this paper is to further highlight the ethical challenges and presentations.
Methods
Three speakers with expertise in ethics, health law, health policy, global health, health information technology, and translational research in epidemiology and public health were selected to present on the social and ethical issues in the current landscape. Dr. S Coughlin presented on the ‘Ethical and Social Issues in Epidemiology’, Dr. L Beskow presented on ‘Ethical Challenges in Genetic Epidemiology’, and Dr. K Goodman presented on the ‘Ethics of Health Informatics’.
Results
New digital sources of data and technologies are driving the ethical challenges and opportunities in epidemiology and public health as it relates to the three emerging topic areas identified: (1) digital epidemiology, (2) genetic epidemiology, and (3) health informatics. New complexities such as the reliance on social media to control infectious disease outbreaks and the introduction of computing advancements are requiring re-evaluation of traditional bioethical frameworks for epidemiology research and public health practice. We identified several cross-cutting ethical and social issues related to informed consent, benefits, risks and harms, and privacy and confidentiality and summarized these alongside more nuanced ethical considerations such as algorithmic bias, group harms related to data (mis)representation, risks of misinformation, return of genomic research results, maintaining data security, and data sharing. We offered an integrated synthesis of the stages of epidemiology research planning and conduct with the ethical issues that are most relevant in these emerging topic areas.
Conclusions
New realities exist for epidemiology and public health as professional groups who are faced with addressing population health, and especially given the recent pandemic and the widespread use of digital tools and technologies. Many ethical issues can be understood in the context of existing ethical frameworks; however, they have yet to be clearly identified or connected with the new technical and methodological applications of digital tools and technologies currently in use for epidemiology research and public health practice. To address current ethical challenges, we offered a synthesis of traditional ethical principles in public health science alongside more nuanced ethical considerations for emerging technologies and aligned these with lifecycle stages of epidemiology research. By critically reflecting on the impact of new digital sources of data and technologies on epidemiology research and public health practice, specifically in the control of infectious outbreaks, we offered insights on cultivating these new areas of professional growth while striving to improve population health.}

However, after decades of research, governance mechanisms remain among the most undertheorized and relatively overlooked dimensions of smart city transitions. To address this problem, we conduct a systematic literature review that connects the fragmented knowledge accumulated through the observation of smart city transition dynamics in 6 continents, 43 countries, and 146 cities and regions. Our empirical work is instrumental in achieving a threefold objective. First, we assemble an overarching governance framework that expands the theoretical foundations of smart city transitions from an innovation management perspective. Second, we elaborate on this framework by providing a thorough overview of documented governance practices. This overview highlights the strengths and weaknesses in the current approaches to the governance of smart city transitions, leading to evidence-based strategic recommendations. Third, we identify and address critical knowledge gaps in a future research agenda. In linking innovation theory and urban scholarship, this agenda suggests leveraging promising cross-disciplinary connections to support more intense research efforts probing the interaction patterns between institutional contexts, urban digital innovation, and urban innovation ecosystems.}

abstract = {Start-ups have revolutionised many economic ecosystems, becoming innovation pioneers around the world. Most are based on data-driven business models, particularly relying on machine learning technologies. However, not all start-ups that use machine learning technologies manage to create and capture value. The existing literature on the use value enabled by information technologies does not take into account the unique capabilities of machine learning. The theory of data network effects offers a promising explanation of how to create value using machine learning. However, it does not explicitly describe how to capture value using machine learning. In contrast, business model theory explains how companies use technologies to create and capture value, but not specifically through the use of machine learning technology. Therefore, this study aims to improve the theoretical understanding of the key drivers of value creation and capture in start-ups with business models driven by this kind of technology. Statistical techniques are used in a sample of 122 start-ups to explore the theoretical relationships between these two theories. The analysis reveals the link between specific value creation and capture factors of the two theories, such as efficiency, novelty, and performance expectancy. The study also provides evidence of the need to adopt a co-evolutionary perspective of value creation and capture through the use of machine learning.}

Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.}

This study examines 1501 sustainability reports using a mixed human-artificial intelligence method based on Python's text mining libraries. This method takes advantage of AI's capabilities to extract information from large samples of data and of human critical thinking to find patterns in those data. Specifically, the method is used to evaluate the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies, analyse how they are deployed worldwide, and investigate their sustainability outcomes. In terms of overall frequency, robots and cybersecurity are the most often reported technologies. Broken down by the firm's region, Asian firms have the highest rate of adoption, while African firms are lagging. Regarding the themes, Industry 4.0 is mainly adopted to improve production processes and customer experience. A small percentage of firms, particularly in Europe and North America, utilize Industry 4.0 to reduce the environmental footprint of their operations. Furthermore, results indicate that Industry 4.0 and sustainability are following two routes. Some firms have massively adopted Industry 4.0 to increase operational efficiency and reaped environmental gains as an indirect consequence of improved operations. Others have chosen to balance the adoption of technologies aimed to increase productivity with innovations whose explicit aim is the reduction of their operations' environmental footprint, such as additive manufacturing. Eastern firms tend to follow the first route while western firms the second. African and South American firms are still at a very early stage in their Industry 4.0 and sustainability journey. At the global level, Industry 4.0 is still far from being utilized as a catalyst to develop sustainability-driven business models.}

Based on a socio-technical perspective, this paper presents a multi- and inter-disciplinary framework to identify and evaluate the competencies necessary for leading digital innovation in the built environment. The framework incorporates three dimensions: digital and technical, governance and management, and ethical and responsible innovation. A review of existing competency frameworks for digitalisation in the urban built environment is presented to identify competency gaps across the three dimensions. The results show that existing frameworks rarely strive for comprehensiveness and are limited in their scope to certain competencies along a single dimension. In addition, studies addressing the need for multi- and inter-disciplinary competencies across the three dimensions are lacking. The paper thus demonstrates that our three-pronged framework is a useful and much needed tool to identify competency requirements for local public, private and community stakeholders to steer place-based digital innovation and ensure public value creation.}

To establish the house of quality matrix, technology-based stakeholders' requirements were identified and classified in four dimensions: economic and financial, technology adoption, sustainability, competencies. Moreover, nine supplier criteria were assumed. Based on expert evaluations, the results suggest that financial credit and supplier collaboration are the most prominent attributes to evaluate suppliers, while environmental commitment is sorted as the least important criterion.

Due to their power, size, and scope, manufacturing multinational enterprises (MNEs) are considered by other organizations as best practice references. If there is already evidence that digitalization favours environmental sustainability, social sustainability still needs to be explored. This study aims to analyze the contribution of the implementation of digital technologies in promoting environmental and social sustainability in European manufacturing MNEs using the Resource-Based View (RBV). A research model was formulated comprising five digital technologies (Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Robotics, Big Data Analytics, and Blockchain) and sustainable environmental and social practices. To test the model, the Partial Least Squares method was applied to a sample of 764 European manufacturing MNEs. The results show that European MNEs still have a low implementation of digital technologies in their business models. Digital technologies positively contribute to achieving these companies' environmental and social sustainability. However, the contributions of implementing each digital technology to environmental and social sustainability are not equal, allowing investment prioritization by manufacturing MNEs according to the strategically defined return. This study contributes to the evolution of RBV considering digital technology as a strategic resource. It focuses on assessing the contribution of five digital technologies to achieving environmental and social sustainability and demonstrates the importance of the digital transition towards greener manufacturing production in environmental and social terms. It also suggests practices managers and policymakers can implement to accelerate digitalization and achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.}

This paper is thus intended to give more enlightenment on the subject, with evidence brought from the textile and clothing industry. Following this objective, a systematic literature review of research articles associated with decision-making in the Industry 4.0 era is performed with a focus on the textile and clothing industry. Articles were retrieved from the Scopus database, and the selection procedure resulted in 61 research papers. Moreover, a content analysis was performed using tables and graphs featuring quantitative results which are grounded on the proposed taxonomy. This study permits to identify some decision-making trends such as data-driven, real-time, decentralized, integrated, and sustainable decision-making. Following these decision-making trends and technologies brought by Industry 4.0, we discuss the keys for a competitive textile and clothing industry of the future.

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has consolidated some trends that already existed in our society. Perhaps one of the most visible is the transformation of society towards greater digitisation. Digitalisation has gained weight in all aspects of our lives, and from the point of view of the health system we find an example in the slow historical adoption of telemedicine, which contrasts sharply with the massive conversion to this technology as a tool for social distancing. In this sense, the homebound population is the one most affected by the pandemic and the one that could benefit the most from the use of telemedicine. Using a netnography approach and based on the stimulus-organism-response paradigm, this study proposes to analyse the evolution of perception about telemedicine using the opinions expressed on Twitter. The primary technical tasks of the study incorporate the analysis of topics and the review of emotions and positive image perception using natural language processing. Specifically, tweets about telemedicine generated by the Spanish community are analysed in this work. The findings show that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected emotions and topics of interest related to telemedicine. This has changed the image that it had and the behaviour of the Twitter community in Spain. In conclusion, the study results suggest that changes in health systems affect people's emotions and behaviours.}

We aim to define collaborative configurations of ecosystem actors in digital servitization based on their value creation and capture and their social base of collaboration. We propose four configurations of inter-firm collaboration, based on the level of joint value creation activities and value capture interdependence among the actors: expanded business, enhanced business, platform business and symbiotic business. We analyze how these different collaboration types operate based on a multi-case study approach using the Social Exchange Theory (SET) to examine actors' interactions. We focus on four elements of SET: trust, commitment, reciprocity, and power. We found that trust, commitment and reciprocity are related to value creation and capture dynamics, while power is mostly affected by other external factors. These four elements allow to define the operationalization of the four types of inter-firm collaboration in digital servitization ecosystem. We contribute to the theory showing how service and digital suppliers interact with the servitized product firm in the ecosystem. Managers can learn the elements involved in different business models and collaboration arrangements for the provision of servitized digital solutions aiming to better decide the servitization strategy they want to follow.}

However, a comprehensive understanding of citizen discontent with the smart city is missing. This study systematically reviews academic research addressing citizen discontent with the smart city. Based on a set of 58 articles, two perspectives on citizens' discontent are identified. One perspective focuses on active discontent: citizens are dissatisfied with the technology, democratic process, and societal impact of the smart city and show different types of behavior to express their discontentment. The other perspective emphasizes passive discontent: citizen discontent does not manifest itself due to citizens' lack of awareness and skills and the absence of channels to express their discontentment. Both perspectives on discontent suggest different government responses respectively to overcome citizen discontent through ‘the right technologies’, ‘the right rules’, and ‘the right information’, or to stimulate critical citizenship through ‘the right to smart city education and empowerment’ and the ‘right to participate and challenge’. Based on our findings, a fine-grained understanding of attitudes and behavior, and government actions to address citizen discontent is developed.}

abstract = {Animal welfare standards are used within the food industry to demonstrate efforts in reaching higher welfare on farms. To verify compliance with those standards, inspectors conduct regular on-farm animal welfare assessments. Conducting these welfare assessments can, however, be time-consuming and prone to human bias. The emergence of Digital Livestock Technologies (DLTs) offers new ways of monitoring farm animal welfare and can alleviate some of the challenges related to animal welfare assessments by collecting data automatically and more frequently. Whilst automating welfare assessments with DLTs may be promising, little attention has been paid to farmers’ perceptions of the challenges that could prevent successful implementation. This study aims to address this gap by focusing on the trial of a DLT (a 3D machinelearning camera) to automate mobility and body condition scoring on 11 dairy cattle farms. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with farmers, technology developers and a stakeholder involved in a farm assurance scheme (N14). Findings suggest that stakeholders perceived important benefits to the use of the camera in this context, from building consumer trust by increasing transparency to improved management efficiency. There was also a potential for greater consistency in data collection and thus for enhanced fairness across the UK dairy sector, particularly on the issue of lameness prevalence. However, stakeholders also raised important concerns, such as a lack of clarity around data ownership, reliability, and use, and the possibility of some farmers being penalised (e.g., if the technology failed to work). More clarity should thus be given to farmers in relation to data governance and evidence provided in terms of technical performance and accuracy. The findings of this study highlighted the need for more inclusive approaches to ensure farmers’ concerns are adequately identified and addressed. These approaches can help minimise negative consequences to farmers and animal welfare, whilst maximising the potential benefits of automating welfare-related data collection.}

We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with Palestinian and international NGOs during and after the lockdown to enhance our understanding of the challenges and opportunities they faced in adopting technology to discharge accountability during a major disruptive event. Three main themes emerged from our analysis. First, the biggest challenge is downward accountability to the most deprived and marginalised beneficiaries due to implications of the digital occupation which caused digital unaffordability and illiteracy, voluntary digital resistance to counter suspicion of surveillance, and female digital disempowerment. Second, upward accountability was less problematic as funders accepted ad hoc technology-based accountability practices, but some concerns remained over the efficacy and sustainability of digital adoption in the long run. Finally, the pandemic granted NGOs new opportunities in utilising technology, which successfully changed their process and practice of accountability.}

Whereas DS work can result in various kinds of artifacts, tools for practitioners are the most promising ones. We first provide several examples of DS work resulting in widely used tools and then identify various challenges in the technological innovation domain that call for tools addressing these challenges. Subsequently, we provide practical guidance on how to prepare manuscripts about designing and testing tools which are likely to have a major impact on practice.}

This is primarily due to the widespread adoption and prevalence of IoT within domestic and critical national infrastructures, as well as inherent security vulnerabilities within IoT endpoints. Therein, botnets have emerged as a major threat to IoT-based infrastructures targeting firmware vulnerabilities such as weak or default passwords to assemble an army of compromised devices which can serve as a lethal cyber-weapon against target systems, networks, and services. In this paper, we present our efforts to mitigate this challenge through the development of an intrusion detection system that resides within an IoT device to provide enhanced visibility thereby achieving security hardening of such devices. The device-level intrusion detection presented here is part of our research framework BTC_SIGBDS (Blockchain-powered, Trustworthy, Collaborative, Signature-based Botnet Detection System). We identify the research challenge through a systematic critical review of existing literature and present detailed design of the device-level component of the BTC_SIGBDS framework. We use a signature-based detection scheme with trusted signature updates to strengthen protection against emerging attacks. We have evaluated the suitability and enhanced the capability through the generation of custom signatures of two of the most famous signature-based IDS with ISOT, IoT23, and BoTIoT datasets to assess the effectiveness with respect to detection of anomalous traffic within a typical resource-constrained IoT network in terms of number of alerts, detection rates, detection time as well as in terms of peak CPU and memory usage.}

To elucidate the role of digital technologies in healthcare, we performed a structured literature review about the state of the art of digital transformation in healthcare to identify how the healthcare sector is undergoing a renaissance due to the pandemic. Our findings show that future research falls into three promising areas: (a) digital health care services enabled by digital technologies, (b) stakeholders' engagement through digital technologies for health care services, and (c) value impact generated by the digital transformation for healthcare stakeholders. We link these areas together, showing how the different digital technologies (smart health technologies, data-enabled and data collection technologies, Industry 4.0 tools and technologies, cognitive technologies, and drug & disease technologies) lead to the provisions of digital services, operational efficiencies, and value creation in the healthcare system. We conclude the article by suggesting various directions for future research and implications for management and practice.}

Combining blockchain-like distributed technology and Airbnb-like sharing economy model, this paper proposes a digital health data marketplace (DHDM) through which patients, as the data producer, can sell their health data to data consumers like medical practitioners, researchers, policymakers and machine learning algorithm developers without compromising privacy and security. In conjunction with the Welsh Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank, a traditional centralised and siloed data repository, DHDM was evaluated in a simulated environment to understand the technical feasibility, regulation compliance and, most importantly, the impact of such marketplace on healthcare 4.0 transformation.}

To overcome these challenges, the European Parliament has recently approved the Regulation 2020/741 on minimum requirements for water reuse to standardise the legal requirements of wastewater to be considered fit for reuse. This regulation also requires elaboration of Water Reuse Risk Management Plans (WRRMPs) for all reclamation facilities of the Union. This review aims to provide a general overview of the current limitations and gaps in systematically applying water-reuse practices, as well as recommendations that could overcome them. To this end, WRRMPs and digital solutions can play a crucial role because they can ensure the safe use of reclaimed water in agriculture and support communications to stakeholders, end-users and citizens.

The presence of various similar and dissimilar risk factors in these companies complicates the known and unknown causal relationships whose interpretation and understanding are difficult. Therefore, EHS improvement has remained a great challenge to be solved by these companies. The design and implementation of ubiquitous systems are supported by the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) as well as their enabling technologies. IoT has been found capable of solving different problems of high-risk companies in regard to EHS-related challenges. A wide window for preference elicitation has been opened to decision experts (DEs) through the development of the q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS). The extensive research conducted into q-ROFS implies a great urge for a decision approach that can use accessible information appropriately to make decisions of the highest rationality. Using the q-ROFS advantages, the present study develops a novel approach with the “entropy-rank sum-weighting integrated approach (ERSWIA)” and “weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS)” model termed as “q-ROF-ERSWIA-WASPAS”. In this line, the q-ROF-ERSWIA is applied to compute the integrated weights of criteria, and the q-ROF-WASPAS is implemented to find the prioritization of organizations. A case study to assess the challenges of IoT-based applications in EHS industries in the era of Industry 4.0 is taken. Comparison and sensitivity studies are discussed to illustrate the usefulness of the presented approach.}

However, there remains a significant gap in VL adoption due to the lack of awareness and familiarity of VL amongst teachers and students. This study examined the key motivational factors impacting the efficacy of VLs to teach students laboratory skills and tasks. The survey-based data for the study was collected using an intrinsic motivation inventory (IMI) scale, self-reported survey responses for extrinsic factors, and a teachers' VL perception scale. Independent sample t-test and automatic linear modeling (LINEAR) were used to analyze the data. The findings show that the animated graphic learning materials of VLs had a higher impact on students' intrinsic motivation than the e-book learning materials. The role of teachers was also crucial in increasing students' motivation levels for performing laboratory experiments using VL. The results also indicate performing VL experiments for longer durations or multiple times, positively influenced students’ laboratory performance.}

Yet, despite significant investments in digital technologies and digital transformation, firms are struggling to yield the most out of them, thereby facing a digital paradox. This scenario has drawn the attention of academics and practitioners leading to a growing body of literature on the relationship between digital technology and business model innovation. Yet, the extant academic research in this area appears highly fragmented. Hence, this study conducts a systematic literature review to gather and synthesize the extant knowledge on this topic. The review identifies four main thematic areas, provides an interpretative framework, and suggests valuable future research directions within each thematic area. The article contributes to the theoretical and managerial discussion on digital-driven business model innovation.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
The success of a tuberculosis digital adherence technology relies on patients’ satisfaction with and the usability of the technology. This study aimed to evaluate treatment satisfaction and usability of a digital medication event reminder and monitor (MERM) device for patients with tuberculosis to address the prespecified secondary endpoint of the SELFTB trial.
Methods
In this multicenter, randomised controlled trial, adults (≥18 years) with new or previously treated, bacteriologically-confirmed, drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis who were eligible to start anti-tuberculosis therapy were recruited from 10 healthcare facilities in Ethiopia. With a computer-generated random number sequence, participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive a 15-day tuberculosis medication supply dispensed with an evriMED500® MERM device to self-administer and return every 15 days or the standard in-person DOT. Both arms were followed throughout the standard two-month intensive treatment phase. Treatment was based on the WHO-recommended two-month fixed-dose-combination of first-line anti-tuberculosis drug delivered as a single daily dose (2RHZE). Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication version 4 (TSQM 1.4©) was used to measure and compare treatment satisfaction between arms. Adapted System Usability Scale (SUS) was used to assess the usability of the device, with emphasis on ease of use, challenges, benefits, motivation, popularity, and recommendation. The findings were correlated with adherence and clinical endpoints including sputum smear conversion and IsoScreen urine isoniazid test results. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04216420.
Findings
Between June 2, 2020, and June 15, 2021, 337 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 109 participants enrolled and completed the satisfaction [control (n = 57) and intervention (n = 52) arms] and usability [intervention arm (n = 52)] questionnaires. TSQM 1.4© geometric mean scores were: Effectiveness 73.25 [geometric standard deviation (GSD) 1.28], Side Effects 100, Convenience 63.31 (GSD 1.45), and Global Satisfaction 77.29 (GSD 1.25). TSQM score was significantly higher in the intervention vs the control: Effectiveness [85.78 vs 63.43, 95% CI 1.35 (1.26–1.45), p < 0.001], Convenience [85.41 vs 48.18, 95% CI 1.77 (1.63–1.93), p < 0.001], and Global Satisfaction [90.19 vs 67.11, 95% CI 1.34 (1.26–1.43), p < 0.001]. There were significant associations between Global Satisfaction and medication adherence (p = 0.017). Average SUS score was 97.45%, which was close to the best imaginable SUS value of 100%. Likelihood to Recommend (LTR) value was ≥9, on a scale of 0–10, for 90.4% of MERM users, yielding higher net promoters. There was no significant association between usability and medication adherence (p = 0.691).
Interpretation
Our findings suggested that treatment satisfaction scores were superior in the intervention vs control arms and across the domains of Effectiveness, Convenience, and Global Satisfaction. There was excellent usability of the MERM device and a significantly higher number of users likely to promote the device. High tuberculosis burden countries may transform patient-centered care through ongoing evaluation and scale-up of digital health innovations.

To attain this degree of efficiency, the integration of virtual and physical components reinforced by artificial intelligence also promises to improve the resilience of these systems against organised and often skillful adversaries. The ability to visualise, validate, and illustrate the benefits of this integration, while taking into account improvements in cyber modelling and simulation tools and procedures, is critical to that adoption. Using Cyber Modelling and Simulation (M&S) this study evaluates the scale and complexity required to achieve an acceptable level of cyber resilience testing in an IoT-enabled critical national infrastructure (CNI). This research focuses on the benefits and challenges of integrating cyber modelling and simulation (M&S) with digital twins and threat source characterisation methodologies towards a cost-effective security and resilience assessment. Using our dedicated DT environment, we show how adversaries can utilise cyber–physical systems as a point of entry to a broader network in a scenario where they are trying to attack a port.}

The abundant research suggested that artificial intelligence (AI) can help organizations handle changes during this challenging period. However, little empirical research has explored whether the presence of AI enhances individual resilience against adversities. Drawing on the reciprocal determinism theory, this study considers the formation of two typical post-adoption behaviors and their subsequent results in individual resilience. The structural equation modeling shows that AI factors (usability and sociability) and personal factors (self-efficacy) determine usage behaviors (routine and infusion use), in turn affecting individual resilience. The OLS results suggest the right half of the U-shaped relationships between infusion use and resilience. Two-step fsQCA offers three configurations resulting in high resilience under the different presence of AI factors and also suggests the roles of user behaviors. The study provides new theoretical enlightenment for the impact of digital service technology on individuals and enriches the existing literature on the usage of digital service technology. The findings provide practical implications for practitioners to design AI products better to improve smart service experience.}

Such disasters are becoming increasingly frequent in rural Australia. This cross-disciplinary study draws together community disaster resilience and digital capability concepts to address a critical gap in our understanding how rural individuals and organisations can effectively prepare for, respond to, and recover from natural disasters using telecommunications. The study adopts an ethnographic methodology, including semi-structured interviews and community workshops, in rural Far North Queensland, Australia. A socio-technical approach enabled the authors to analytically highlight both technical and social aspects of digital capability at each phase of disaster resilience: preparedness, response, and recovery. In contrast to the dominant focus on technical infrastructure and capability in the literature, this study builds on emerging work focused on social factors of disaster resilience that are facilitated by digital technologies. It particularly demonstrates how digital capabilities contribute to the essential disaster resilience factors of social capital, community competence, economic development, and information and communication. This research problem is particularly critical as rural Australia and other parts of the country and the world experience more frequent and more severe natural disasters.}

CE practices offers innovative approaches to optimize various SC processes leading to sustainable growth. However, adoption of CE practices faces many roadblocks where application of disruptive digital technologies can be a game changer. The extant literature lacks the investigation on drivers, enablers, critical barriers, and challenges in adopting disruptive digital technologies along with CE practices in SC. To fill this lacuna, an in-depth state-of-the-art of review of 187 articles has been conducted which resulted in the identification of 49 drivers and enablers, and 25 barriers and challenges. Furthermore, a framework has been proposed to elucidate the connection between disruptive digital technologies and CE performance in SC. Our review reveals that digital technology enabled CE practices helps to improve several performance metrics like resource optimization, waste reduction, product life cycle, occupational health, social performance, product safety and quality, and customer loyalty and satisfaction. The proposed framework will help industry practitioners, researchers, and policy makers in devising strategies for adopting disruptive digital technologies enabled CE practices in SC to achieve sustainability.}

However, adopting digital technologies is not easy due to barriers that may arise during this process. While prior literature offers initial insights into barriers at the firm level, these studies pay less attention to these barriers' multi-level nature. Focusing only on one particular level while ignoring others may not unleash the full potential of DTs in a circular economy. To overcome barriers, it's necessary to have a systemic understanding of the phenomenon, which is missing in previous literature. By combining a systematic literature review and multiple case studies of nine firms, this study aims to unpack the multi-level nature of barriers to a smart circular economy. The primary contribution of this study is a new theoretical framework composed of eight dimensions of barriers. Each dimension provides unique insights related to the multi-level nature of the smart circular economy transition. In total, 45 barriers were identified and categorized into the following dimensions: 1. Knowledge management (five barriers), 2. Financial (three barriers), 3. Process management & Governance (eight barriers), 4. Technological (ten barriers), 5. Product & Material (three barriers), 6. Reverse logistic infrastructure (four barriers), 7. Social behaviour (seven barriers), and 8. Policy & Regulatory (five barriers). This study examines how each dimension and multi-level barrier affects the transitions toward a smart circular economy. An effective transition copes with complex, multidimensional, multi-level barriers, which might require mobilization beyond a single firm. Government actions need to be more effective and correlated with sustainable initiatives. Policies also should focus on mitigating barriers. Overall, the study contributes to smart circular economy literature by increasing theoretical and empirical understanding of digital transformation barriers towards circularity.}

The findings demonstrate that 71 % of students consider that the digital competence of their faculty impacts their learning process positively. The study carries out a literature review proposing a model of four elements affecting the student self-perception of learning: 1) educators' digital skills; 2) the use of technology for communication, monitoring, and assessment; 3) educators' engaging in digital ecosystems; and 4) students' data security in the learning process.

Therefore, BT holds considerable promise for the industrial and service sectors; however, its implementation during the procurement stage in a sustainable construction project (SCP) is a bottleneck because of inherent and unknown barriers. Though some attempts on the identification of these barriers have been carried out, the literature lacks a thorough investigation into the relationships and inner dependencies among the related barriers within the realm of SCP. Thus, a novel combination of fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (fuzzy DEMATEL) and social network analysis (FDSNA) is proposed in this paper to fill this gap; FDSNA uncovers causal relationships among leading barriers that impede the adoption of BT within an SCP, and it determines the most critical barriers by modeling their complex interrelationships in related intricate environments. The obtained results suggest “inadequacies in implementing block chain-based policies” and “unawareness and resistance to BT among customers” as the most significant barriers, and “technology immaturity,” “market uncertainty and competition,” and “technology accessibility” are identified as the most critical. These results present managers and governmental bodies with an inclusive picture regarding the major obstructions to the successful implementation of BT, and it is expected to open avenues to accrue benefits from such leading-edge technologies at a greater pace.}

This city's resources are wirelessly connected to different constrained devices (such as sensors, robotics, and actuators). However, the communication of this wireless information is threatened by several malicious attacks, cyber-attacks, and hackers. This is due to unsecured IIoT networks that were exposed as a potential back door entry point for the attacks. Consequently, this study aims to develop a security framework for the smart cities’ sustainability edge computing vulnerabilities using Petri Net and Genetic Algorithm-Based Reinforcement Learning (GARL). First, a common trust model for addressing information outflows in the network using a distributed authorization algorithm is proposed. This algorithm is implemented on a secure framework modeling in Petri Net called secure trust-aware philosopher privacy and authentication (STAPPA) for mitigation of the privacy breach in the networks. Genetic Algorithm-based Reinforcement Learning (GARL) is used to optimize the search, detect anomalies, and shortest route during the agent learning in the environment. The detection and accuracy rate results obtained over a secure framework using reinforcement learning are 98.75, 99, 99.50, 99.75, and 100% during simulation in the network environment. The average sensitivity of the detection rate is 1.000, while the average specificity outcome is 0.868. The result of the GARL simulation model obtained shows the best distance of 238.84 * 10−3 fitness when the search space is optimized by reducing the number of chromosomes to 10 in the model. These approaches help to detect anomalies and prevent unauthorized users from accessing edge computing components in the city architecture.}

We introduce the degree of outward internationalization and home-country inward foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows as moderators in achieving firm performance as a result of digitalization. Using a panel dataset of 571 U.S. manufacturing firms, we find a curvilinear relationship between digitalization and performance. The top quartile of digitalization efforts is rewarded by significant profitability. Moreover, high levels of outward internationalization and high net-FDI inflows increase the performance gains attributable to high levels of digitalization. Overall, the resource-orchestration theory complements new OLI advantages in explaining firm performance in the digital world.}

abstract = {Hydropower globally represents the main source of renewable energy, and provides several benefits, e.g., water storage and flexibility; on the other hand, it may cause significant impacts on the environment. Hence sustainable hydropower needs to achieve a balance between electricity generation, impacts on ecosystems and benefits on society, supporting the achievement of the Green Deal targets. The implementation of digital, information, communication and control (DICC) technologies is emerging as an effective strategy to support such a trade-off, especially in the European Union (EU), fostering both the green and the digital transitions. In this study, we show how DICC can foster the environmental integration of hydropower into the Earth spheres, with focus on the hydrosphere (e.g., on water quality and quantity, hydropeaking mitigation, environmental flow control), biosphere (e.g., improvement of riparian vegetation, fish habitat and migration), atmosphere (reduction of methane emissions and evaporation from reservoirs), lithosphere (better sediment management, reduction of seepages), and on the anthroposphere (e.g., reduction of pollution associated to combined sewer overflows, chemicals, plastics and microplastics). With reference to the abovementioned Earth spheres, the main DICC applications, case studies, challenges, Technology Readiness Level (TRL), benefits and limitations, and transversal benefits for energy generation and predictive Operation and Maintenance (O&M), are discussed. The priorities for the European Union are highlighted. Although the paper focuses primarly on hydropower, analogous considerations are valid for any artificial barrier, water reservoir and civil structure which interferes with freshwater systems.}

abstract = {In recent years, the increase in the use of services in cloud, fog, edge, and IoT ecosystems has been very notable. On the one hand, environmental sustainability is affected by this type of ecosystem since it can produce a large amount of energy consumption which translates into CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. On the other hand, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of these ecosystems has increased considerably. Thus, it is necessary to apply policies and techniques to maximize sustainability within these ecosystems. Some of these policies and techniques are those based on artificial intelligence. However, the current processing of these policies and techniques can also consume a lot of resources. From this perspective, this article aims to clarify whether the sustainability of cloud/fog/edge/IoT ecosystems is improved by the application of artificial intelligence. To do this, a systematic literature review is developed in this paper. In addition, a set of classifications of the analyzed works is proposed based on the different aspects related to these ecosystems, their sustainability, and the applicability of artificial intelligence to improve them.}

Organizations use these data to run technologies such as smart assistants, augmented reality, and robotics. Most often, these organizations seek to make a profit. Individuals can, however, also provide personal data to public databases that enable nonprofit organizations to promote social welfare if sufficient data are contributed. Regulators have therefore called for efficient ways to help the public collectively benefit from its own data. By implementing an online experiment among 1696 US citizens, we find that individuals would donate their data even when at risk of getting leaked. The willingness to provide personal data depends on the perceived risk level of a data leak but not on a realistic impact of the data on social welfare. Individuals are less willing to donate their data to the private industry than to academia or the government. Finally, individuals are not sensitive to whether the data are processed by a human-supervised or a self-learning smart assistant.}

To implement cyber security programs effectively through the RG 5.71, it is necessary to quantitatively assess cyber risks. However, this can be challenging due to limited historical data on threats and customized Critical Digital Assets (CDAs) in nuclear facilities. Previous works have focused on identifying data flows, the assets where the data is stored and processed, which means that the methods are heavily biased towards information security concerns. Additionally, in nuclear facilities, cyber threats need to be analyzed from a safety perspective. In this study, we use the system theoretic process analysis to identify system-level threat scenarios that could violate safety constraints. Instead of quantifying the likelihood of exploiting vulnerabilities, we quantify Security Control Measures (SCMs) against the identified threat scenarios. We classify the system and CDAs into four consequence-based classes, as presented in NEI 13–10, to analyze the adversary impact on CDAs. This allows for the ranking of identified threat scenarios according to the quantified SCMs. The proposed framework enables stakeholders to more effectively and accurately rank cyber risks, as well as establish security and response strategies.}

Meanwhile, machine learning has exploded with popularity over the years, with many circular economy literatures examining its usefulness in its predictive qualities to support management, optimisation, and recovery of useful resources from organic waste. This review paper examines advancements in machine learning for macronutrient recovery in city organic waste systems for a circular economy. The use of ML will greatly improve the scalability, transparency, productivity and accuracy of nutrient: recovery technologies, logistics, dissemination, and reuse. ML can also be combined with hardware to automate tedious waste separation, recovery and agricultural tasks using drones, hydroponics and satellites. Meanwhile, crop yields, nutrient demand-supply efficiencies, food security, environmental soil monitoring, and prosumer involvement could all increase.

Although there are various studies that explored the importance of cybersecurity solutions, the impact of production and usage of these solutions on the natural environment and their economic impact has been rarely researched. The objective of this research is to investigate the environmental and economic impact of cybersecurity solutions. An extensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been performed on three cybersecurity solutions to assess and compare their environmental impact. Based on global warming potential, the embodied carbon footprint was determined. Carbon footprint and operational costs were used to calculate Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis and these data were then used to compare the eco-efficiency of the three cybersecurity solutions. This research compares three cybersecurity solutions: Next Generation DataGuard (NGD), Current State of Art Solution (CSAS), and a Generic Cybersecurity Solution (GCS), to identify an economically viable and environmentally friendly cybersecurity solution. The result of the analysis indicated that NGD was approximately 58% and 88% more energy-efficient than CSAS and GCS, respectively. Also, the LCC of NGD was approximately 6%- 12% lower than CSAS and 22%- 40% lower than GCS in selected provinces in Canada. The eco-efficiency of CSAS was approximately 60% less than NGD. Next Generation DataGuard is found to be a successful solution in this research among the three solutions. This study will be useful to researchers, cybersecurity industries, and policymakers to develop informed decisions on cybersecurity solutions.}

To ensure business survivability during the current and post-COVID-19 era, it is crucial to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to renovate traditional manufacturing activities. The fifth industrial revolution, Industry 5.0 (I5.0), and artificial intelligence (AI) offer the overwhelming potential to build an inclusive digital future by ensuring supply chain (SC) resiliency and sustainability. Accordingly, this research aims to identify, assess, and prioritize the AI-based imperatives of I5.0 to improve SC resiliency. An integrated and intelligent approach consisting of Pareto analysis, the Bayesian approach, and the Best-Worst Method (BWM) was developed to fulfill the objectives. Based on the literature review and expert opinions, nine AI-based imperatives were identified and analyzed using Bayesian-BWM to evaluate their potential applicability. The findings reveal that real-time tracking of SC activities using the Internet of Things (IoT) is the most crucial AI-based imperative to improving a manufacturing SC’s survivability. The research insights can assist industry leaders, practitioners, and relevant stakeholders in dealing with the impacts of large-scale SC disruptions in the post-COVID-19 era.}

In Europe, policies are being focused on investments to make this the “Digital Decade”. Against this backdrop, the aim of the study is to analyse the competitiveness of the 27 countries of the European Union by producing a synthetic indicator that includes factors relating to innovation (measured by the Global Innovation Index) and to digitalization (based on the Digital Economy and Society Index), which in turn yields an annual ranking of the analysed economies between 2017 and 2021. Furthermore, in a second stage of the analysis, three panel data models are estimated to determine how factors relating to economic, social and environmental development foster advances in technology and innovation. The multicriteria decision-making method Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is applied to establish a ranking of EU members according to their level of digitalization and innovation, while the Prais-Winsten regression with Panel Corrected Standard Errors is used to obtain robust estimators. The results of the ranking indicate that the countries hold similar positions in the five years analysed, with Sweden leading the way throughout, which reflects its stable development in terms of digitalization and innovation. A digital and innovation gap can be seen between the top and bottom positions of the ranking, that is, between north-central and south-eastern Europe. Finally, the estimated models suggest that governments should promote wealth, employment, research and infrastructure investments in order to improve innovative and technological development in their countries.}

The Internet of Things (IoT), sensor-based, is one of the most current advanced tools that can handle appropriate measures to control data operations across manufacturing industries. The demand for predictive machine reliability and quality drives the development of intelligent manufacturing technologies. To this goal, a variety of machine learning algorithms are being studied. Data protection and monitoring is also another concern that is a critical component of the organization. To overcome these issues, the proposed method uses Blockchain Technology (BCT) and Machine Learning to secure the information operations and manage a dataset. Significant data approaches were employed to organize and evaluate the obtained dataset. BCT allows collecting sensor user access data, whereas ML classifiers distinguish between normal and malicious behavior to detect attacks. DoS, DDoS, intrusion, a man in the middle (MitM), brute force, cross-site scripting (XSS), and searching are the attacks detected by BCT. Furthermore, the hybrid prediction technique assessed the fault detection prediction component. The program's quality control was set using non-linear machine learning techniques that represented the complicated world and determined the actual positive rate of the standard control methodology used by the platform. The experimental result shows that the proposed method outperforms empirical metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and response time. The proposed method efficiently provides security between innovative manufacturing transactions.}

A 3D LAS can facilitate a better understanding, as well as a more efficient registration and clear visualisation of the RRRs than a 2D LAS, through 3D digital modelling of the legal ownership of underground objects below the surface. To register the objects below the surface in a 3D LAS, 3D physical data as well as 3D legal data shall either be registered and integrated into one model, or the physical and legal models shall be linked effectively. In the context of this paper, the IFC (ISO 16739:2018) is used to register the 3D physical data, while the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM, ISO 19152:2012) is used to structure the legal data. To achieve the link of the respective legal and physical data, the classes of the LADM are mapped to the elements of the IFC. A standardised workflow is presented in this paper where the inclusion of the legal, organisational and technical aspects of modelling the legal ownership results in a comprehensive approach to solve the challenges that currently prevent the registration of the RRRs of 3D objects below the surface in LASs. This paper also provides a general method for mapping the LADM classes to the IFC entities. Two case studies were conducted to assess the technical aspect of the workflow, where the RRRs of objects below the surface and the parcels above the surface were registered and visualised on the 3D geospatial visualisation platform CesiumJS.}

Women in early labour are typically encouraged to delay maternity unit admission, but they may find this challenging without appropriate professional support.
Background
Despite pre-pandemic research which identified potential advantages of video-calling in early labour, implementation of such service has not been reported.
Aim
To explore mothers’ perspectives on potential use of video-calls during early labour.
Methods
A multi-centre descriptive qualitative study was undertaken in UK and Italy. Ethical approval was gained and ethical processes were followed. Six virtual focus groups were conducted with 37 participants, 24 mothers who gave birth in the UK and 13 who gave birth in Italy. Line-by-line thematic analysis was performed and themes agreed.
Findings
Two themes emerged: 1) women’s expectations of video-calls’ content and features; 2) technological challenges and solutions. Mothers responded positively to the concept of video-calling in early labour. Receiving guidance, information on coping with pain and advice on timely access in early labour was perceived as key. Women highlighted the importance of accessible, reliable and user-friendly technology. Equitable access, technological literacy, acceptability and privacy were considered as challenges to implementation, with solutions proposed to overcome disparities.
Discussion and conclusion
Guidance and training should be provided to midwives, with designated resources to build a service that is accessible, acceptable, safe, individualised and respectful for mothers and birth companions. Further research should explore feasibility, acceptability, clinical and cost-effectiveness.}

abstract = {We aim to answer the question of the effect of a social-purpose-driven ecosystem on value capture from digital health platforms. We call the social-purpose-driven ecosystem a phenomenon which seeks social impact before profits and aims to empower citizens for individual and collective well-being. Thus, capturing value from digital platforms embedded in a social-purpose-driven ecosystem fundamentally differs from profiting from purely commercial digital platforms and poses significant challenges to platform owners and public policy. Previous research has focused mainly on profiting from technological innovations but has yet to consider the contextual role of the social-purpose-driven ecosystem. We applied the Profiting from Innovation (PFI) framework to fill this gap. Furthermore, based on the results of the multiple-case study of five European digital healthcare platforms, we extend the PFI framework. As a result, we define four unique contingencies which enable value capture from digital healthcare platforms embedded in a social-purpose-driven ecosystem: 1) multilayer value creation, (2) multipurpose complementary assets, (3) emerging dominant design, and (4) distributed socio-economic returns mechanisms. The study offers two managerial and policy contributions. First, it calls on platform owners and policymakers to acknowledge the contextual effect of a social-purpose-driven ecosystem. Second, multilayer value creation, multiple complementary assets, dominant design and distributed socio-economic returns mechanisms can positively affect capturing value from digital healthcare platforms.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) now forms a more and more important part of human lives. After years focussed on the development of AI, the initial hype about its many expected benefits has gradually given way to rising ethical concerns about its inherent risks and dangers. Efforts to confront and contain the most serious risks related to AI have now prompted a number of legislative or regulatory proposals at the national, regional and global level. One of the most comprehensive regulatory initiatives is the European Union's proposal for an Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA), which was released in April 2021 with a view towards establishing a legal framework for trustworthy AI. To this end, the draft AIA pursues a proportionate horizontal and risk-based regulatory approach to AI, broadly classifying AI into the categories of unacceptable risks, high risks and low or minimal risks. The unacceptable risks are those that are deemed to contravene European Union values, and therefore, they are considered to be ‘prohibited AI practices’ by Article 5 AIA. The prohibited AI practices are classified into four categories, namely 1) AI systems deploying subliminal techniques; 2) AI practices exploiting vulnerabilities; 3) social scoring systems; and 4) ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems. The proposed regulatory approach, however, appears problematic given the four categories’ inherent interrelatedness and the numerous possibilities for their mutual combination and entwinement. It is also problematic from the perspective of the human mind, as each of the four categories alone allows for the manipulation of human thought and behaviour, thereby endangering freedom of thought and other fundamental rights. In the context of the proposed AIA, both aspects give rise to unknown and unsolved conundrums that create difficult regulatory challenges that raise the necessity to also look at the wider implications of these technologies for the entire legal system. As these conundrums often find their expression in paradoxes and oxymora, this article calls for a wider interdisciplinary debate and advocates a different regulatory strategy using these concepts to transcend the limitations inherent in dualistic or dichotomous modes of legal thinking.}

abstract = {The threat of cyberattacks on smart manufacturing systems has been rapidly growing with the potential for a multitude of different attack types, varying from traditional espionage to sabotaging physical assets and products. A thorough and systematic understanding of the different elements of cyberattacks, from motivation to potential consequences and respective countermeasures, is a crucial stepping-stone towards proactive management of manufacturing cybersecurity risks. This understanding is essential for developing the necessary tools to identify, prevent, detect, diagnose, and mitigate cyberattacks. In response, several attack taxonomies have been proposed in the literature as methods for recognizing and categorizing various attributes of cyberattacks, including potential attack vectors/methods, targets/locations, and consequences. However, those taxonomies only cover selected attack attributes depending on the research focus, sometimes accompanied by inconsistent naming and definitions. These seemingly different taxonomies often overlap and can complement each other to create a comprehensive knowledge base of cyberattack attributes that is currently missing in the literature. Additionally, there is a missing link from creating structured knowledge by using a taxonomy to applying this structure for cybersecurity tools development and aiding practitioners in using it. To tackle these challenges, first, this article reviews and analyzes current taxonomical classifications of manufacturing cybersecurity threat attributes and countermeasures, as well as the proliferation of the scope and coverage in current taxonomies. As a result, these taxonomies are compiled into a more comprehensive and consistent meta-taxonomy for the smart manufacturing space. The resulting meta-taxonomy provides a holistic analysis of current taxonomies and integrates them into a unified structure. Based on this structure, this paper identifies gaps in current attack taxonomies and provides directions for future improvements. Finally, the paper introduces potential use cases for attack taxonomies in smart manufacturing systems for assessing security threats and their associated risks, devising risk mitigation strategies, and informing the application of cybersecurity frameworks.}

However, there are no guarantees that (only) desirable outcomes will develop. The creation and exploitation of vast data stockpiles raise substantial concerns about privacy, data security, equity, and the potential for harm from data misuse. Meaningful approaches to data governance within and across organizations are critically important to facilitate digital innovation and to balance social, economic and technical benefits and risks for individuals, organizations, and societies.

Several measurement scales have been developed in this regard, as measuring users’ ISA is paramount. Although ISA specific scales are very important, yet what methodological rigor they use in terms of initial conceptualization of ISA, data collection and analysis during the development, and scale validation of such scales are some unknown aspects. Therefore, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing ISA specific scales to address all the above concerns. A popular method, PRISMA, is utilized, and a total of 24 articles that match with criteria of this research are included for the final in-depth analysis. Also, a holistic evaluation framework is developed containing three phases and 19 criteria. Findings revealed that most studies treat ISA as a multi-dimensional construct, and ISA researchers rarely conduct both pilot testing and pre-text evaluation while validating and refining the initial scales. Additionally, several articles did not report some of the essential elements used for checking the rigor of factor analysis, and evidence for validities of the identified scales is inadequate. Consequently, existing ISA specific scales must be improved both in terms of the methodological thoroughness of the scale development procedure and their validities. Moreover, not only justifying why the development of a new scale is necessary, but also improving the quality of the existing scales by doing multiple iterations is significant in the future. Likewise, the inclusion of all the dimensions of ISA, while generating the initial items pool is an important aspect to be considered. A thorough discussion, recommendations for future research, conclusions, and study limitations are provided.}

This article offers substantial new insights and analysis into the complex question of whether cyber insurance can help organisations in mitigating the threat of ransomware, particularly its impacts. Having conducted an interview or workshop with 96 industry professionals spanning the cyber insurance, cyber security, ransomware negotiations, policy, and law enforcement sectors, we identify that ransomware has been a key cause of the ‘hardening’ of the cyber insurance market, which is exhibited at almost all levels of the market. Such hardening has been beneficial in raising the security standards required prior to purchase, but has also created a situation where some organisations may not be able to acquire viable cyber insurance at all. In presenting the outcomes of our thematic analysis of the interview and workshop outputs, the paper provides significant new empirical evidence to support the theory that cyber insurance can act as a form of governance for improving cyber security amongst organisations. Nonetheless, the hardening market does nothing to increase the penetration of cyber insurance. Questions were also raised as to the likelihood of unintended unethical – and potentially illegal – outcomes given the professionalisation of a remediation process that has to determine the most cost-effective solution to an organisation being held ransom. We conclude that insurance, at best, can help to mitigate the ransomware threat for those that can access it, as part of a wider basket of actions that must also come from different stakeholders.}

This is further compounded by the need for the industry to answer new challenges to meet the requirement of the International Maritime Organization 2020. The aim of this work is to illustrate how blockchain technology may be adopted for aiding in bunker dispute resolution. To demonstrate how blockchain may aid in disputes within the bunker industry, this paper first examines the existing bunker supply process, which involves the formation of contracts under English law, the Bunker Delivery Notes, the different types of disputes that may arise during a bunker transaction and the methods of dispute resolution utilised by the industry. Furthermore, the current literature in relation to blockchain technology and blockchain smart contracts is examined. Finally, interviews and surveys within the industry have been conducted to identify the benefits and challenges in adopting blockchain technology. The research found that blockchains may benefit the bunker supply chain offering the effective resolution of bunker quality disputes. Furthermore, blockchains may also serve as a verification tool for electronic bunker delivery notes, which may aid quality and quantity bunker disputes as well as compliance with the new International Maritime Organisation 2020 requirements. As a result, despite the research having shown blockchain to be situationally dependent and having an element of legal uncertainty, blockchain does offer a solution to aid in bunker disputes and for improving the trust and credibility within the bunker industry.}

abstract = {The current planetary crisis and the perceived urgency necessitates more sustainable production and consumption patterns. Businesses, particularly the multinationals, play a key role in transitioning to a circular economy, which provides a promising approach to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Industry 4.0 technologies can theoretically support this transition and enable circular economy through, for example, data-driven and smart business processes. However, merging these new technologies with a circular economy is not a straightforward and well-established process and it fundamentally changes the business value chain. Therefore, this paper provides a systematic overview to help better understand the transition process to circular business models and the enabling role of industry 4.0. Merging these concepts underlines that many factors are interrelated and should be investigated in a holistic way instead of siloes. The findings imply that changes transcend business boundaries, including new value chain characteristics and operation models and indicate the interconnected nature of certain factors along the product lifecycle, including service-based models, circular design, reverse flows, consumers and users, and collaborations. This paper proposes a conceptual transition framework to address how new circular business models can integrate digitally adaptive transformations and proposals for future research are reflected upon.}

The literature review was an important source of information for this study and employed a historical design. From the review, the findings indicate that eLearning accommodates all people regardless of their geographical background and enhances learner-centeredness and self-study opportunities. Findings also indicate that it enhances access to updated content for students and is cost-effective as opposed to conventional methods that need the presence of the teacher, buildings, teaching and learning materials, and physical libraries. However, the findings indicate that eLearning faces the challenges such as health-related problems because of excessive use of computers for a long time which may result in low vision. Findings also indicate the challenge of the digital divide and a lack of stable Internet services and connectivity as they are rarely accessed in many teacher colleges and universities including, a lack of availability of computers for students in African countries. Further, the findings indicate the other challenge of eLearning based on its vulnerability to online attacks on the websites that may lead to questioning the quality of education provided through the eLearning model. The key argument in this study is that eLearning will remain an unavoidable option for the provision of teacher education in the world and African countries in particular at the threshold of a global pandemic similar to COVID-19 regardless of the risks involved. African Governments need to invest in digital learning by strengthening Internet connectivity and improving the Information, Communication, and Technology (ICT) infrastructure, i.e., the provision of computers and Televisions (TVs) to educational institutions to sustain students’ learning during pandemics similar to COVID-19 and other unpredictable situations.}

In the last decade, advanced quantitative technological forecasting methods based on the various applications of data science approaches have been proposed. Text mining is one of the key approaches used to examine large datasets consisting of scientific publications and patent documents with the aim of offering foresight for a selected area. However, the existing related studies either perform a qualitative approach by analysing the recent data to identify the emerging topics or use extrapolation techniques to predict the future values of some statistical terms or the future frequency of some important keywords. In this study, different from such related studies, we propose a deep learning-based framework to predict future co-similarity matrix representing the possible new and disappearing interactions between the words in the future. For this purpose, word vectors are generated using a word embedding technique and the temporal changes of the associations between the words are modelled using Long Short-Term Memory networks for the future estimation of the word embedding matrix. The text mining area is chosen as a case study. The clusters of the terms extracted from the predicted word embedding matrices were analysed and potentially emerging areas were identified for different prediction horizon lengths. The accuracy of the proposed model was analysed based on a set of evaluation metrics that measure the amount of overlapping between the actual and predicted word maps. The quantitative analysis showed that the proposed system can successfully identify the emerging and disappearing areas and can be used as a decision-making tool for the future projection of other areas.}

However, some improvements were recently recorded from the solid mineral sector as the sector contributed meaningfully to the GDP in the last three years. The contribution of this sector is still extremely low as compared to the oil sector. Hence, there is need to explore the recent technology in improving the solid mineral contribution to GDP. This study therefore explores the application of industrial 4.0 for selecting the best strategy in the Nigerian mining sector using the extended combined compromise solution (COCOSO) technique with the fuzzy cognitive map (FCM). The fuzzy COCOSO is structured by using causal-and-effect weights. Notably, the FCM and fuzzy-COCOSO are implemented in a reliable environment as the Z-number concept is used for overcoming uncertainty of system. Ten copies of questionnaires comprising nine mining 4.0 strategies (alternatives) and 15 criteria were provided by a ten-member team of experts. The main goals in the decision system were minimising implementation costs (G1), maximising financial incomes from smart mining strategies (G2), maximising government financial support to use smart technologies (G3), minimising hazardous events (G4), and maximising safety in operations (G5), which are considered in the ZFCM topology. In the final step of research, the effectiveness and robustness of the nine proposed mining 4.0 policies were investigated by using a parametric sensitivity analysis. Based on the presented hybrid model, it is concluded that the third policy (A3, internet of things) is the best option for intelligent mining in the Nigerian mining sector. It was confirmed by an expert team that obtained results were valid and that the factors and conditions in the study area were worth evaluating and validating.}

abstract = {Cyber security incident handling is a consistent methodology with which to ensure overall business continuity. However, specifically handling incidents for critical information infrastructures is challenging owing to the inherent complexity and evolving nature of the threat. Despite the number of contributions made to cyber incident handling, there is little evidence of literature that focuses on modelling activities that will enhance developers’ abilities to model incident handling processes and activities according to different views. Modelling languages of this nature should integrate essential concepts and a descriptive implementation process in order to enable developers to analyse, represent and reason about the crucial incident handling efforts required to support critical information infrastructures. The aim of this paper is, as part of the CyberSANE EU project, to develop a Cyber Incident Handling Modelling Language (CIHML) that focuses explicitly on modelling incident handling in the context of a critical information infrastructure. The work is innovative in its approach because it consolidates concepts from various domains such as security requirements, forensics, threat intelligence, critical infrastructures and cyber incident handling. The approach will allow the phases of the incident handling lifecycle to be modelled from three different views (critical information infrastructures, threat and risk analysis, and incident response). An implementation process is also proposed, which will serve as a comprehensive guide for developers in order to create these modelling views. Finally, CIHML is evaluated using a real-life scenario from the CyberSANE project to demonstrate its applicability. The incident observed had a severe impact on the overall business continuity of the context studied. The results obtained from the study show that CIHML can help critical information infrastructure operators to identify, evaluate, represent and model cyber incidents in critical information systems, in addition to providing the support required to determine the response strategies needed in order to mitigate these cyber-attacks.}

The review further details the role of grid codes and international standards in maintaining dynamic stability in power systems with extremely high up to 100% variable renewable generation. Finally, discussion and recommendation pathways are provided to inform industries and accelerate a secure power system transition to meet Net Zero targets.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a hierarchical coordinated control strategy for PV inverters to keep voltages in low-voltage (LV) distribution grids within specified limits. The top layer of the proposed architecture consists of the designed automatic voltage regulation (AVR) application, which has access to voltage measurements and grid parameters from the LV distribution grid, both current and historical. The AVR application solves a constrained optimization problem, which provides a set of local control set-points that bring the voltage across the grid within bounds. The middle layer consists of a local Volt/VAR controller, which is adjusted by the AVR app, while the bottom layer is the inner-loop controller of the PV inverter. The proposed method not only improves the voltage quality in the grid but also manages the reactive power outputs of PV inverters efficiently. A digital twin of the cyber-physical system has also been employed that interacts with the control system to ensure its appropriate operation. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated on a representative low-voltage feeder located in Denmark.}

Numerous ways of addressing these issues have been suggested. In light of the complexity of this discussion, we undertook a Delphi study with experts in the field to determine the most pressing issues and prioritise appropriate mitigation strategies. The results of the study demonstrate the difficulty of defining clear priorities.

abstract = {The dynamic development of the global economy, associated with the implementation of the Industry 4.0 idea, significantly affects the policies of individual countries and regions. Changes connected with this process include the digitalization of not only economy but practically all areas of life. In order to keep pace with this development and thus meet the growing competition on the global market, it is necessary to quickly adapt to the changes in question. This applies not only to all kinds of enterprises, but also to individual countries and regions. The following article assesses the level of digital maturity in a group of the EU countries that established the so-called Three Seas Initiative in 2015. These countries, like the EU as a whole, are taking a number of actions to modernize and adapt their businesses and economy to the global level. Based on a selected set of 20 determinants, characterizing the most important 9 technologies related to the idea of Industry 4.0, a comprehensive study was conducted to assess the level of digital maturity among these countries in terms of Industry 4.0 technologies implemented by enterprises and to determine their similarity in this regard. In order to achieve these objectives, a multi-stage research methodology was developed. In the first stage, statistical analyses of the adopted determinants were carried out (descriptive statistics, the Gini index, the Lorenz curves). Then, by means of the CRITIC and Grey Relational Analysis, the level of digital maturity in the use of Industry 4.0 digital technologies among these countries and their enterprises was assessed. Based on the determined values of the digital maturity index and its standard deviation, the digital maturity level classes of these countries were created. Their similarities, on the other hand, were identified using the Kohonen artificial neural networks. In addition, the Tau Kendall rank correlation coefficients were calculated between the economic parameters of studied countries and their digital maturity indicators. This comprehensive approach allowed for a reliable assessment of the digital maturity of studied countries, taking into account the most important digital technologies. Based on the results, the highest level of digital maturity in terms of the use of Industry 4.0 technologies in enterprises was found for the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Estonia, and the lowest level for Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. The results should also be used when developing a common economic policy for countries in similar groups and for the whole Three Seas Initiative. The research carried out fills the research gap in assessing the digital maturity of a large group of EU countries located in its central and eastern parts and presents a new original research methodology in this area, also in terms of the links between the level of digitalization of enterprises and the level of economic development of countries.}

As a result, some Industry 3.0 technologies are identified as prerequisites for the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies. Taking into account this information, a previously proposed Key Performance Indicator is enhanced to better assessing the degree of automation and digitalization of a company, and it is proposed as a novel diagnostic tool for measuring the degree of readiness to implement Industry 4.0. A real-world case study of a metal-mechanical industry company is shown as an application of the proposed diagnostic tool. Additionally, a methodology for implementation of Industry 4.0 in, principally, small and medium-sized enterprises is proposed.}

abstract = {Industry 4.0 technologies have been revolutionizing the financial sector over the past few decades through the emergence of disruptive technologies. These disruptive technologies have also given rise to a new monetary taxonomy known as “digital currencies.” One form of digital currency that provides a more effective, environmentally friendly, stable, and reasonably priced payment alternative is stablecoin, an artificial intelligence-driven payment rail. However, it poses unique risks to the broader financial system, putting the country's economy at risk if it is adopted as a mainstream means of payment. In this context, the present study identifies and prioritizes several major risk categories and their classifications that prevent stablecoins from becoming mainstream payment instruments. Three sequential stages were followed to complete the entire research. The initial phase identified four risk categories and their classifications through a systematic literature review. Thereafter, Pythagorean fuzzy delphi was used in the study to validate the identified risk categories. To prioritize these risks, the authors employed a Pythagorean fuzzy analytical hierarchy and a combined comprehensive solution approach in the final stage. The results of this study revealed that technical risks, which are the biggest impediment to the widespread adoption of stablecoins as a means of payment, were the most influential criterion, followed by macroeconomic risks and legal and regulatory risks. The least significant criterion has been discovered to be user-centric risks. In sub-criterion ranking, monetary stability risks, relative price stability risks, concentration risks, money laundering (ML)/terrorist financing (TF) and other illicit activities, oracle risks, smart contract failures, operational failures, privacy risks, and consumer protection risks are the leading risks. This study is relevant to individuals, investors, researchers, policymakers, and regulators in the long-term evolution of the stablecoin ecosystem.}

Despite the expected benefits, the adoption of AI varies from one smart city to another, due in part to barriers that can inhibit a smart city from adopting AI. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive view of the barriers faced by smart cities. Through a systematic literature review, this study identifies 18 primary and secondary barriers grouped into three main categories — technology, environment, and organization. This research contributes to the literature by developing a typology of AI adoption barriers based on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) perspective. The typology provides a novel mapping of the barriers to AI adoption faced by smart cities and suggests directions for further investigation through a cohesive research agenda. At a practical level, the findings will allow policymakers, planners, and citizens to make more informed decisions about AI adoption. Practical implications are also proposed for guiding smart cities to increase the adoption of AI.}

The number of asthma mHealth options is growing, classified into four discrete categories based on technology type: standalone apps, digital inhalers, digital spirometers, and other mHealth devices used in asthma care. Evidence for asthma mHealth effectiveness is emerging, but systematic assessment is challenging because of technological heterogeneity. To attain more general clinical viability, challenges include advancing the evidence for mHealth effectiveness; promoting accessibility and inclusivity; sustaining patient engagement and successful integration into clinical workflows; ensuring mHealth safety; and considering future regulatory, economic, and pedagogical needs. If these challenges are met, asthma mHealth may help to deliver personalized digital asthma care when combined with novel artificial intelligence approaches, to improve the validity of future asthma research, and to enhance the provision of virtual asthma care. As mobile technology becomes a greater part of our lives and investment and interest in mHealth continues to grow, providers who care for patients with asthma must prepare for this mHealth digital revolution and lobby for safe, effective, and equitable mHealth solutions.}

abstract = {Background
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder. People living with MS (plwMS) require long-term, multidisciplinary care in both clinical and community settings. MS-specific mHealth interventions have advanced in the form of clinical treatments, rehabilitation, disease monitoring and self-management of disease. However, mHealth interventions for plwMS appear to have limited proof of clinical efficacy. As native mobile apps target specific mobile operating systems, they tend to have better interactive designs leveraging platform-specific guidelines. Thus, to improve such efficacy, it is pivotal to explore the design characteristics of native mobile apps used for plwMS.
Objectives
This study aimed to explore the design characteristics of native mobile apps used for adults living with MS in academic settings.
Methods
A scoping review of studies was conducted. A literature search was performed through PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library. Per native mobile apps, characteristics, persuasive technology elements and evaluations were summarized.
Results
A total of 14 native mobile apps were identified and 43% of the identified apps were used for data collection (n=6). Approximately 70% of the included apps involved users (plwMS) whilst developing (n=10). A total of three apps utilized embedded sensors. Videos or photos were used for physical activity interventions (n=2) and gamification principles were applied for cognitive and/or motor rehabilitation interventions (n=3). Behavior change theories were integrated into the design of the apps for fatigue management and physical activity. Regarding persuasive technology, the design principles of primary support were applied across all identified apps. The elements of dialogue support and social support were the least applied. The methods for evaluating the identified apps were varied.
Conclusion
The findings suggest that the identified apps were in the early stages of development and had a user-centered design. By applying the persuasive systems design model, interaction design qualities and features of the identified mobile apps in academic settings were systematically evaluated at a deeper level. Identifying the digital functionality and interface design of mobile apps for plwMS will help researchers to better understand interactive design and how to incorporate these concepts in mHealth interventions for improvement of clinical efficacy.}

In general, researchers desire to achieve global blockchain systems within a sustainable manufacturing domain; however, a number of technical challenges have come to exist in the recent decade, for instance, consensus algorithms and computing paradigms that can meet the privacy protection requirements of manufacturing systems. Therefore, an integrated decision-making framework called Pythagorean fuzzy-entropy-rank sum-Combined Compromise Solution (PF-entropy-RS-CoCoSo) is developed in this study, including two main phases. In the first phase, the PF-entropy-RS method is applied to obtain the subjective and objective weights of criteria to evaluate the technical challenges of transforming blockchain technology for a sustainable manufacturing paradigm in the Industry 4.0 era. The PF-CoCoSo model is then utilized in the second phase to assess the preferences of organizations over different technical challenges of the blockchain technology transformation for the sustainable manufacturing paradigm in the Industry 4.0 era. An empirical case study is taken to assess the main technical challenges of blockchain technology transformation for the sustainable manufacturing paradigm. Furthermore, a comparison analysis and a sensitivity investigation are made to demonstrate the superiority of the developed framework.}

abstract = {Healthcare information security is becoming a significant responsibility for all healthcare organisations and individuals. Innovative medical equipment and healthcare apps are vital to patient care, yet they are often the target of hackers. Moreover, attackers are silently working against healthcare data. Once a hacker has gained access to a network, they might install ransomware to lock down essential services or encrypt files until a specified ransom is paid. Businesses are frequently compelled to pay the ransom, hoping the money is eventually recovered since the healthcare sector is time-sensitive. Although less common, network-connected devices can be taken over and used to distribute incorrect medications or alter a machine's functionality. So, there is a need to implement cyber security in healthcare to protect all information. In comparison to other industries, security duties in the healthcare industry are particularly broad and new. This is especially true given that data is accumulated and accessed from various destinations. Data on a specific patient is gathered from various sources, including hospital and lab records, insurance records, fitness apps, trackers and gadgets, health portals, and many more. It can be easily protected by using cybersecurity technology. This paper briefs about cybersecurity and its need in healthcare. Several tools, traits and roles of cybersecurity in the Healthcare Sector are studied. Finally, we identified and studied the applications of cybersecurity in healthcare. For hackers, a patient's aggregated data might be regarded as a goldmine, providing them with a detailed biography of an individual, including basic information, health trends, family history, and financial details. The importance of Data access in the healthcare sector emerges from numerous endpoints, which can be regarded as the weak spots of the healthcare data management system and can also open up an infringement in the medical data management infrastructure.}

abstract = {Building on emerging debates on the ‘dark’ and ‘bright’ side of digital globalization, and calls for considering its environmental and social implications in more detail, this perspective article seeks to ‘unravel’ these components of ‘the digital age’ for International Business (IB). Inspired by the affordance perspective developed in Information Systems research, we offer IB scholars a new approach to ‘zoom in’ on the (potential) role of individual novel technologies in addressing specific sustainable development issues. Three examples illustrate the relevance of this approach for multinationals and for developing innovative research avenues in IB, which extend existing insights on digital globalization.}

abstract = {Industry 4.0 has received inordinate attention from the business as well as research communities. Along with the development of Industry 4.0 applications and the diversity of potential alternatives, Multi-Attribute Decision Making (MADM) techniques have been employed by researchers as systematic approaches to support the decision-making processes. However, as the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies requires considerable capital, and as it is relatively difficult to identify the suitable MADM method for the decision-making process in certain conditions, it becomes necessary to determine which components of Industry 4.0 are most commonly in demand of MADM applications of decision making, and which MADM techniques are mostly preferred by researchers and businesses for varied directions of Industry 4.0. Therefore, this study aims to provide a comprehensive review of MADM methods and their applications for different components of Industry 4.0. A methodology, including a review framework, is provided for the related analyses. The proposed framework includes analyses concerning methods, subtopics, and bibliometry along with the related exploratory tables and figures. Finally, the trends and research gaps are clearly stated to shed light on the further research areas taking into consideration different challenges that can be encountered by researchers, along with a set of propositions to potentially overcome them.}
