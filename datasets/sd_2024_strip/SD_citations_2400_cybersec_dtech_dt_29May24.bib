abstract = {Advances and innovations are crucial for a sustainable electricity system that includes smart grid technologies, renewable energy sources, and greater energy efficiency. These technologies are often layered on top of the existing infrastructure and legacy information systems. The management and utilization of the data generated from the different components of the electrical system are critical for the successful deployment and operation of this system. This paper reviews the issues and opportunities of the use of Big Data for electric utilities. Big Data provides the opportunity to better monitor, correct, and integrate smart grid technologies and renewable energy. At the same time, data management and utilization must be integrated into organizational operations if the potentials are to be realized. Electric utilities are conservative, heavily-regulated, and concerned with both system reliability and overall profitability. Thus, technological, economic, institutional, and policy constraints must all be addressed. After reviewing these issues and opportunities, we empirically analyze whether these are part of the discussions about electric utilities with federal policymakers. The results show that while conversations about electric utilities overall are plentiful, conversations about data in the context of electric utilities are relatively rare.}

With blockchain technology, the ledger necessary to verify and record identity and asset ownership for transactional access - once the purview of trusted central institutions (development banks, Bretton Woods Institutions, large-scale investment firms, etc.) - is free from the limitations imposed by centralized controls. While a number of old needs now served by these institutions will become obsolete, new blockchain-enabled institutional mechanisms will address a variety of remaining needs more efficiently. New needs will also emerge to be addressed by old, new, and blockchain-refined institutional mechanisms. A continuous iterative process is imperative during such periods of rapid change. Global financial institutions must be responsive to the cultural shift and dynamic societal values accompanying blockchain innovation.}

abstract = {A deep transformation of the electrical grid system at the global level is expected in the near future, with new economic relations between energy suppliers and consumers. This is the smart grid framework, which can integrate the behavior of all connected users, who become prosumers, to ensure a sustainable energy supply in an efficient, economical and safe manner. Smart grid projects have a significant impact on electricity consumers through shifts in consumer behavior, culture and lifestyle. The aim of this paper is to explore the degree of investigation of the main socio-economic features, in terms of private and social costs, which are relevant for smart grids development and public acceptance. To this aim, a literature review of 148 peer-reviewed scientific journal articles on smart grids has been conducted, developing an original taxonomy for the socio-economic features in terms of private (direct) costs directly associated with the monetary costs paid by consumers, and social (indirect) costs constituted by consumers' perception, privacy, cyber security and regulation. The importance of the analysis of social costs arising from externalities is that they may hinder the deployment of specific technologies, even if these technologies appear to be useful based on private costs. The results reveal that the explored literature mainly deals with private costs, although an emerging literature starts to address the social costs that may hamper smart grids deployment. The paper reviews new opportunities and challenges for further research, bridging the gap between engineering and socio-economic research areas, including business, organizational applications, policy and security issues. The resulting enrichment of interdisciplinary know-how can be the basis for the sustainable development of current and future generations.}

Using an urban ecology lens, we provide some reflections that need to forgo any wider-scale implementation of the Smart City-model with the goal to enhance urban sustainability. We discuss that the Smart City literature must better include analysis around social sustainability issues for city dwellers. Focus here should start on health issues and more critical analysis about whom the Smart City is for. Also, the literature must address issues of resilience and cyber security, including how Smart City solutions may affect the autonomy of urban governance, personal integrity and how it may affect the resilience of infrastructures that provide inhabitants with basic needs, such as food, energy and water security. A third major gap in this literature is how smart city developments may change human-nature relations. Focus here should start on how Smart City technologies may hinder or support children’s learning towards a stronger psychological connection with nature. Discussions are also needed on how the Smart City model may affect pro-environmental behavior more broadly.}

Results are based on semi-structured interviews with 55 senior auditors and IS auditors. These auditors worked in ten practice offices in the Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and United Kingdom public sectors. We manually coded 23 interview transcripts and used the Leximancer tool to extend this coding to the remaining transcripts through automated text analysis. The analysis allowed the identification of relevant “common statements” representing the prominent and shared perceptions of the IS auditor role amongst these auditors. These common statements provided a basis for the development of an initial explanation theory. One new construct presented in this theory is the practice office's “IS audit emphasis”, which represents the practice office's emphasis upon the relationship between the IS auditor role and the audit team. The explanation theory provides a richer description of current audit practice regarding the IS auditor's role in public sector financial audit than currently exists. Consequently, this research provides insights for those involved in the education and training of auditors by developing a foundation for a more complete understanding of the IS auditor role.}

For forensic examinations in these environments, knowledge and skills are needed in the field of hardware, networks and data analysis. For forensic examiners, this paper is meant to be a crash course on control systems and their forensic opportunities, focussing on the differences compared to regular IT systems. Assistance from experienced field engineers during forensic acquisition of control systems seems inevitable in order to guarantee process safety, business continuity and examination efficiency. For people working in the control system community, this paper may be helpful to get an idea about specific forensic issues about which they would normally not bother, but may be crucial as soon as their systems are under attack or become part of a law enforcement investigation. For analysis of acquired data, existing tools for network security monitoring have useful functionality for forensic applications but are designed for real-time acquisition and often not directly usable for post-mortem analysis of acquired data in a forensically sound way. The constant and predictable way in which control systems normally behave makes forensic application of anomaly-based threat detection an interesting topic for further research.}

The development of the digital thread has been challenged by the inherent difficulty of aggregating and applying context to data from heterogeneous systems across the product lifecycle. This paper presents a reference four-tiered architecture designed to manage the data generated by manufacturing systems for the digital thread. The architecture provides segregated access to internal and external clients, which protects intellectual property and other sensitive information, and enables the fusion of manufacturing and other product lifecycle data. We have implemented the architecture with a contract manufacturer and used it to generate knowledge and identify performance improvement opportunities that would otherwise be unobservable to a manufacturing decision maker.}

Regulatory agencies worldwide have announced guidelines for cyber security related to nuclear issues, including U.S. NRC Regulatory Guide 5.71. It is important to evaluate cyber security risk in accordance with these regulatory guides. In this study, we propose a cyber security risk evaluation model for nuclear instrumentation and control systems using a Bayesian network and event trees. As it is difficult to perform penetration tests on the systems, the evaluation model can inform research on cyber threats to cyber security systems for nuclear facilities through the use of prior and posterior information and backpropagation calculations. Furthermore, we suggest a methodology for the application of analytical results from the Bayesian network model to an event tree model, which is a probabilistic safety assessment method. The proposed method will provide insight into safety and cyber security risks.}

Electricity generation accounts for almost half of the emission; besides, conventional electrical production based on fossil fuel is becoming more and more expensive. One approach to significantly slow down global warming is to drive our society away from the current fossil fuel fiesta and use only renewable power such as solar and wind energy. Another approach is to improve the management of energy production, transmission, and distribution. Part of the latter solution is on the supply side, where one possible solution is to develop continent-wide smart power grids and energy storage systems. However, an equally important part of the solution is on the demand side, where technologies and applications that can work with this type of unpredictable energy consumption are becoming necessary. The smart power grid with new sources of data, fast growth of information, and proactive management requires new strategy for business and operational management. In this paper we discuss how Cloud computing model can be used for developing Smart Grid solutions. The Cloud computing model is based on the delivery of computing as a service, whereby storage, software and information are provided to computers and other devices as a commodity over the Internet. The advantages of Cloud computing – reduced costs, increased storage, on-demand performance, and better flexibility – have motivated many companies in recent years to move their IT operations to the cloud; the same advantages can be used to achieve the most important future goals of a large-scale Smart Grid, such as energy savings, two-way communication, and demand resource management.}

This configuration (programming) is performed using Hardware Description Language (HDL), making FPGAs a form of HDL Programmed Device (HPD). In the nuclear field, FPGAs have seen use in upgrades and replacements of obsolete Instrumentation and Control (I&C) systems. This paper expands upon previous work that resulted in extensive FPGA failure mode data, to allow for the application of the OECD-NEA failure modes taxonomy. The OECD-NEA taxonomy presented a method to model digital (software-based) I&C systems, based on the hardware and software failure modes, failure uncovering effects and levels of abstraction, using a Reactor Trip System/Engineering Safety Feature Actuation System (RTS/ESFAS) as an example system. To create the FPGA taxonomy, this paper presents an additional “sub-component” level of abstraction, to demonstrate the effect of the FPGA failure modes and failure categories on an FPGA-based system. The proposed FPGA taxonomy is based on the FPGA failure modes, failure categories, failure effects and uncovering situations. The FPGA taxonomy is applied to the RTS/ESFAS test system, to demonstrate the effects of the anticipated FPGA failure modes on a digital I&C system, and to provide a modelling example for this proposed taxonomy.}

The purpose of this paper is to investigate in what sense and at what rate the domain of manufacturing in the UK is transitioning into a major service-oriented field and what types of manufacturing-related activities are most/least suitable for future servitization. Hence, the paper addresses the following questions: i) To what extent has Servitization been adopted in the UK? – What impact is Industry 4.0 currently making? ii) What types of services are currently being offered as a result of industry 4.0? iii) What pros/cons/opportunities/threats does Industry 4.0 bring to British Servitization? – What wider economic issues will make an impact? The research summarized in this paper presents an answer to the outlined questions and draws conclusions as to how this field may further develop in future. The main contributions of this research are the closing of a critical gap in literature by investigating the relationships between the two fields of Servitization and Industry 4.0, and the creation of a framework to allow companies to make themselves aware of Industry 4.0-related services, whilst ensuring these new service innovations are offered in-line with their current business model.}

However few scholars have investigated ways in which the concept can be applied to building intrinsic motivation in employees. This is a particularly important area for research, as new generations who have been brought up with computer games become the dominant cohort within the workforce. This paper summarises the literature on game playing as a motivator, and outlines a variety of studied motivational responses to gamified systems as evoked from different categories of users, including students, consumers and employees.

abstract = {Bring your own devices have become a new symbol of industrial and education institutional culture to date. A single individual can gain access to personal data anytime at anywhere of his/her workplace due to the advanced WiFi/5G network and cloud technology. The most convenient way for us to access to cloud data is to use personal smartphone. However, smartphone is somewhat vulnerable (because of its innate disadvantage, e.g., low security protection and limited computation resource) while encountering with malicious attacks in open network. Mobile users may be the victims of a recent new type of attack - advanced persistent threat (APT), since attackers may penetrate into different levels of cloud and mobile infrastructures to eavesdrop, steal and temper data. This survey paper introduces some security/privacy risks on mobile cloud in the view point of applied cryptography. Meanwhile, it provides some insights as possible solutions for the risks.}

There is a dominant paradigm at work that values the multistakeholder approach and encourages dialogue and equal representation. While, in principle, this model has developed for the good of all participating countries, we illuminate tensions and incongruities experienced by African nation states. We use three analytical frames that focus on the way countries are measured and ranked as ICT ready - what we refer to as accumulating evaluative value, the forms of resistance that emerge in order to counter the universalising values of Internet governance, and the way spatial geographies of Internet use and access are mapped out politically. We draw attention to a paradox of stakeholder participation arguing that African nations experience continual disempowerment and alienation in their compliance with international directives.}

abstract = {Fog computing as an extension of cloud computing provides computation, storage and application services to end users. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a well-known cryptographic technology for guaranteeing data confidentiality and fine-grained data access control. It enables data owners to define flexible access policy for data sharing. However, in CP-ABE systems, the problems of the time required to encrypt, decrypt and attribute update are long-standing unsolved in the literature. In this paper, we propose the first access control (CP-ABE) scheme supporting outsourcing capability and attribute update for fog computing. Specifically, the heavy computation operations of encryption and decryption are outsourced to fog nodes, thus the computation operations for data owners to encrypt and users to decrypt are irrelevant to the number of attributes in the access structure and secret keys, respectively. The cost brought by attribute update is efficient in the sense that we only concentrate on the update of the ciphertext associated with the corresponding updated attribute. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is secure under the decisional bilinear Diffie–Hellman assumption. The proposed scheme is efficient, and the time of encryption for data owners and decryption for users are small and constant. The computational ability of fog nodes are fully utilizing during the access control, so the tiny computing cost is left to end users with resource-constrained devices.}

The constant emergence of the novel technologies often leads to dynamic threats from both internal and external service providers. We consider the implementations of mobile cloud-based financial services an important approach of service provisions, which also causes risks to privacy protections due to the data sharing with the unknown third parties. The data generated by mobility are usually associated with mobile users’ personal privacy information. This paper addresses this issue and proposes an approach proactively protect financial customers’ privacy information using Attributed-Based Access Control (ABAC) as well as data self-deterministic scheme. The proposed approach is called Proactive Dynamic Secure Data Scheme (P2DS), which aims to guarantee the unanticipated parties cannot reach the privacy data. There are two main algorithms supporting the proposed scheme, which are Attribute-based Semantic Access Control (A-SAC) Algorithm and Proactive Determinative Access (PDA) Algorithm. The main contributions of this paper have three aspects. First, we propose a semantic approach for constraining data accesses. Second, we propose a user-centric approach that proactively prevents users’ data from unexpected operations on the cloud side. Finally, the proposed scheme has a higher-level secure sustainability since it can deal with dynamic threats, including the emerging and future hazards. We have examined that our proposed scheme had a quality performance matching our expected goal.}

We need an additional, complementary perspective to help us, legal scholars, earn and hold serious positions in the diverse disciplinary teams that we need to participate in, in order to adequately investigate (and inform on) persistent problems concerning personal-data protection as faced by legislators. In this article we investigate whether the subject matter of data protection law, identified as Personal Data Community (hereinafter PDC), can be treated as a complex adaptive system (hereinafter CAS). This proposition is premised on the argument that the PDC exhibits key traits of CAS, including systemic, dynamic and complex characteristics. And we further show how complexity theory can help legal scholarship (without losing its identity) to join and add value to diverse disciplinary research and advisory teams. In this article, we aim for a stepping-stone (establishing that data protection law addresses a complex adaptive system with all of its corollaries), rather than for final solutions.}

On this basis, this research would like to investigate which are the necessary skills and expertise young engineers require to be ready for the Industry 4.0 framework. In particular, a questionnaire was developed to analyze this situation. It has been administered to students enrolled in the first and second year of the engineering undergraduate degrees held in three Italian universities: Brescia, Udine and Cassino. During two different academics years, a total of 463 students participated to the survey. The questions were aimed to investigate some key issues of Industry 4.0, and the students’ digital belief and behaviors at their entrance in the university education system. The collected answers provided a picture of the actual situation in these three universities with some relevant considerations about engineering education. So, the fundamental question that authors want to answer is “Are the Italian engineering students effectively ready for Industry 4.0 or do we still work on it?”}

It is needless to stress the significance of human error reduction during an accident in nuclear power plants (NPPs). Unexpected shutdowns caused by human errors not only threaten nuclear safety but also make public acceptance of nuclear power extremely lower. We have to recognize there must be the possibility of human errors occurring since humans are not essentially perfect particularly under stressful conditions. However, we have the opportunity to improve such a situation through advanced information and communication technologies on the basis of lessons learned from our experiences. As important lessons, authors explained key issues associated with automation, man-machine interface, operator support systems, and procedures. Upon this investigation, we outlined the concept and technical factors to develop advanced automation, operation and maintenance support systems, and computer-based procedures using wired/wireless technology. It should be noted that the ultimate responsibility of nuclear safety obviously belongs to humans not to machines. Therefore, safety culture including education and training, which is a kind of organizational factor, should be emphasized as well. In regard to safety culture for human error reduction, several issues that we are facing these days were described. We expect the ideas of the advanced MMIS proposed in this paper to lead in the future direction of related researches and finally supplement the safety of NPPs.}

First, ASEAN experienced a faster pace of convergence, compared to the rest of the world, in level of ICT diffusion over the past 10 years. Second, all ASEAN countries, including Singapore – the leading player, face increasing challenges in competing with income-level peers on ICT diffusion performance. ASEAN is a global hub of ICT hardware production and a fast-growing center of ICT services exports. In terms of revealed comparative advantage, ASEAN as an economy is strong in ICT hardware but remains weak in ICT services. The paper discusses policy insights drawn from the study and proposes a strategic policy framework to guide ASEAN’s concerted efforts to embrace the ICT revolution for development.}

Thus, identifying these vulnerabilities during risk analysis becomes an important part for effective industrial risk evaluation. However, nowadays, safety and security are analyzed separately when they should not be. This is because a security threat can lead to the same dangerous phenomenon as a safety incident. In this paper, a new method that considers safety and security together during industrial risk analysis is proposed. This approach combines bowtie analysis, commonly used for safety analysis, with a new extended version of attack tree analysis, introduced for security analysis of industrial control systems. The combined use of bowtie and attack tree provides an exhaustive representation of risk scenarios in terms of safety and security. We then propose an approach for evaluating the risk level based on two-term likelihood parts, one for safety and one for security. The application of this approach is demonstrated using the case study of a risk scenario in a chemical facility.}

abstract = {The term ‘Industry 4.0’ was coined to mark the fourth industrial revolution, a new paradigm enabled by the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT) into the production and manufacturing environment. The vision of Industry 4.0 emphasizes the global networks of machines in a smart factory setting capable of autonomously exchanging information and controlling each other. This cyber-physical system allows the smart factory to operate autonomously. For instance, a machine will know the manufacturing process that needs to be applied to a product, what variation to be made to that product etc., so that the product can be uniquely identifiable as an active entity whose configuration and route in the production line is unique. As the collaboration between suppliers, manufacturers and customers is crucial to increase the transparency of all the steps from when the order is dispatched until the end of the life cycle of the product, it is therefore necessary to analyze the impact of Industry 4.0 on the supply chain as a whole.}

abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) is a recent challenging area in the health monitoring domain. There are several concerns in this area ranging from energy efficient communication to designing delays efficient protocols that support nodes dynamicity induced by human body mobility. This paper focuses on the convergecast or data gathering protocols in WBAN. Our contribution is twofold. First, we extensively analyze the impact of postural body mobility on various classes of multi-hop convergecast strategies. Our study does not limit itself to the existing state-of-the-art in WBAN, we adapted to WBAN settings strategies from the areas of Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). We evaluate these strategies in terms of resilience to the human mobility, end-to-end delay and energy consumption, via the OMNeT++ simulator that we enriched with a realistic channel model issued from the recent research on biomedical and health informatics. Our simulations show that strategies that perform well in DTN and WSN cannot be just extrapolated to WBAN without a deeper investigation. That is, existing convergecast strategies for DTN or WSN do not perform well with postural body movements because of the topological partitioning provoked by important link attenuations due to signal obstructions either by clothes or by the body itself. Secondly, our extensive simulations give us valuable insights and directions for designing a novel convergecast strategy for WBAN called Hybrid that presents a good compromise in terms of resiliency to mobility, end-to-end delay and energy consumption.}

Vehicular communications provide connectivity in scenarios requiring mobility, in a Vehicle-to-Anything (V2X) framework. This requires addressing different issues, from the connection of a vehicle sensor to the immediate road receiver, to the exchange of service data between an embarked smartphone and a remote service provider. However, as the technologies evolved, and started being deployed, aspects such as integration and interoperability, and the related mechanisms of standardization, certification, and homologation gained importance. Both the technologies and the standardization at European and international level are briefly described in this chapter.}

This paper investigates the determinants of cyber-safety behaviors, particularly the factors associated with using anti-virus software in the general Internet user population, through a conceptual model about the determinants of non-digital preventive actions. We tested the Health Behavior Model, which considers perceptions about threats and expectations about behavior as the main determinants of health-related preventive behaviors, using a survey of Israeli Internet users 18 years old and older (N = 1850). Findings show that gender, age, education, seniority online and frequency of Internet use are basic determinants of anti-virus preventive behaviors. Nevertheless, similar to preventive health behaviors, beliefs about digital threats and actions to thwart them appear to account for more variance in anti-virus preventive behaviors than socio-demographic characteristics and Internet use. Our findings provide an innovative conceptual model and imply that the fight against cybercrime can take cues from health behavior studies demonstrating the role of perceptions and beliefs in reducing online threats. Furthermore, health behavior models are useful frameworks to conceptualize behavioral reactions to threats and to study cyber-safety.}

Efforts are being done all over the globe to reduce this greenhouse effect; and renewable energy technologies to combat climate changes, which require extensive changes to the current electricity generation and distribution systems. To meet this goal, it is required to optimize the grid operations and available resources to meet the ever increasing energy demands in an efficient, effective and environment sustainable way. It has been found that smart grid technologies have not been so popular due to some obstacles that are hindering its maturation and rapid deployment. An attempt has been made to identify and analyze the barriers to implement smart grid technologies adoption. Twelve relevant barriers towards implementation of smart grid technologies have been identified from extensive literature review and duly validated with experts׳ (from academia and industry) opinions. Also, valuable experts׳ opinions have been utilized to identify contextual relationships among these important barriers and a hierarchical model has been developed based on Interpretive Structural Modeling methodology. Matrice d׳Impacts Croises-Multipication Applique´ an Classment (MICMAC) analysis has also been used to: classify the barriers based upon dependence and driving power; and validate developed ISM based model. “Lack of Regulatory Framework” barrier has been identified as driver or independent level barrier i.e. most important bottom level barrier hindering adoption of smart grid technologies. The developed structured model will help to understand interrelationships and interdependencies among the identified barriers to implement smart grid technologies. Different solutions for handling these identified barriers have also been suggested in the paper. Organizations involved in power generation and distribution may be benefited by understanding of these barriers, their interactions and suggested mitigation solutions towards effective adoption of smart grid technologies.}

Coupling this elevated risk of physical and technical aggression with the ever-increasing global per capita energy demand – there has been witnessed a continually growing reliance on nuclear energy for baseline power generation, a form of electricity production that requires both the necessary international safeguards and controls for its safe use. As more and more of the global energy budget is provided by low-carbon sources (over highly-polluting fossil fuels), the volume of nuclear material in existence will grow substantially – requiring considerable attention and policy to ensure its long-term safety and security. This commentary describes the vast range of policy challenges faced by the nuclear industry resulting from the rapid technological advancements being made across society, and how these directly (and indirectly) affect global nuclear security, as well as providing a thorough discussion on how best these challenges may be overcome.}

A primary concern in HIEs is the need for explicit authorization of information exchange in an auditable manner. However, we find that existing approaches for authorization in health information systems exhibit several drawbacks in meeting the needs of HIE, with non-cryptographic approaches lacking a secure and reliable mechanism for access policy enforcement, while cryptographic approaches being too expensive, complex and limited in specifying policies. This paper aims to overcome these drawbacks by presenting a simple and efficient patient-centric authorization protocol for information sharing in cloud-based HIE systems. The proposed protocol is built using a novel trapdoor hash-based proxy signature scheme, and ensures that the authorization is authentic with respect to both providers and patients, and complies with the established access control policies. Features of the proposed protocol include auditability, non-interactive and on-demand operation, and specification and secure/reliable enforcement of flexible access control policies. A detailed security and performance analysis shows that the proposed protocol is provably secure against forgery under the discrete log assumption, and achieves the best overall performance compared to other well-known schemes in the literature.}

abstract = {In modern society, information and communication technology (ICT) has been applied to various areas such as home, industry, and finance. Therefore, social networks using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been constructed. As ICT continues to be used in various modern applications, security vulnerabilities from legacy ICT have been inherited by social IoT network systems. To guarantee the safety of these applications, these networks must be protected from various cyberattacks. A variety of security technologies and products have been developed for this purpose. However, the most important task in dealing with cyberattacks is to inspect the current security status of a social IoT network system. Many types of vulnerability quantification methods exist for inspecting the security vulnerabilities of network systems. However, with legacy methods, quantification results lack objectivity. In this study, to compensate for this limitation, we propose a game-theory-based vulnerability quantification method using attack tree, which consists of three steps: game strategy modeling, cost-impact analyzation, and payoff calculation. We present a case study for a social-IoT-based network environment. Using the proposed method, we believe social IoT network system security experts will be able to cope with security incidents more effectively. The proposed method can be used as a reference for constructing a safer social IoT network system.}

abstract = {Socio-technical issues for Systems of Systems (SoS) differ in several ways from those for systems, mainly because the individual systems that are components of the SoS are usually owned by different organisations, each responsible for the optimisation and operation of its own system. Consequently, management of the SoS is about negotiation and management of the interfaces. Because of issues of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs), commercial confidence, and the like, there is seldom sufficient, timely information in circulation about the SoS. Surprises are endemic to SoS, and resilience is a fundamental requirement. This paper outlines the different characteristics of SoS compared to ordinary systems, discusses many of the socio-technical issues involved, and then outlines a generic approach to these issues, treating the SoS as a ‘wicked problem’. Endemic to this is the need for governance, which is discussed briefly. This is followed by a description of the evident gaps in knowledge about the functioning of SoS, and a listing of tool classes, the development of which would enable progress to be made more effectively. Finally, the paper discusses how the SoS approach might be the best way to entrain ICT to address global drivers, thus pointing to the importance of the SoS approach.}

A Smart Production Laboratory (Smart Lab) has been developed as part of the project. The Smart Lab is a small Industry 4.0 factory containing a number of digital technologies which are integrated into a physical Industry 4.0 demonstrator. Since its establishment in August 2016, a number of projects have been initiated involving more than 50 students and researchers from various departments at Aalborg University. Most of these projects have been made in collaboration with large end-user companies and a number system integrators and technology providers (most of which are SMEs). There has been a great industrial interest in the Smart Lab. Over the last six months, more than 150 companies have visited the lab, and the interest in engaging in projects by far exceeds our capacity. In the future, we are going to focus on setting up collaboration with SME end-users. Furthermore, we will investigate more systematic approaches for improving the knowledge sharing between the on-going projects and enabling better knowledge co-creation. The paper will present the Smart Lab, and demonstrate how we are teaching and researching using a collaborative approach engaging with end-user, vendors and system integrators.}

More specifically: While users claim to be very concerned about their privacy, they nevertheless undertake very little to protect their personal data. This systematic literature review explores the different theories on the phenomenon known as the privacy paradox. Drawing on a sample of 32 full papers that explore 35 theories in total, we determined that a user’s decision-making process as it pertains to the willingness to divulge privacy information is generally driven by two considerations: (1) risk-benefit evaluation and (2) risk assessment deemed be none or negligible. By classifying in accordance with these two considerations, we have compiled a comprehensive model using all the variables mentioned in the discussed papers. The overall findings of the systematic literature review will investigate the nature of decision-making (rational vs. irrational) and the context in which the privacy paradox takes place, with a special focus on mobile computing. Furthermore, possible solutions and research limitation issues will be discussed.}

Multiple, partial identities emerge distributed across cyberspace divorced from the physical person. The representation of personal characteristics in data sets, together with developing technologies and systems for identity management, in turn change how we are identified. Trustworthy means of electronic identification is now a key issue for business, governments and individuals in the fight against online identity crime. Yet, along with the increasing economic value of digital identity, there are also risks of identity misuse by organisations that mine large data sets for commercial purposes and in some cases by governments. Data proliferation and the non-transparency of processing practices make it impossible for the individual to track and police their use. Potential risks encompass not only threats to our privacy, but also knowledge-engineering that can falsify digital profiles attributed to us with harmful consequences. This panel session will address some of the big challenges around identity in the digital age and what they mean for policy and law (its regulation and protection). Questions for discussion include: What does identity mean today? What types of legal solutions are fit for purpose to protect modern identity interests? What rights, obligations and responsibilities should be associated with our digital identities? Should identity management be regulated and who should be held liable and for what? What should be the role of private and public sectors in identity assurance schemes? What are the global drivers of identity policies? How can due process be ensured where automated technologies affect the rights and concerns of citizens? How can individuals be more empowered to control their identity data and give informed consent to its use? How are biometrics and location-tracking devices used in body surveillance changing the identity landscape?}

abstract = {Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that have common traits such as, high eye pressure, damage to the Optic Nerve Head and gradual vision loss. It affects peripheral vision and eventually leads to blindness if left untreated. The current common methods of pre-diagnosis of Glaucoma include measurement of Intra-Ocular Pressure (IOP) using Tonometer, Pachymetry, Gonioscopy; which are performed manually by the clinicians. These tests are usually followed by Optic Nerve Head (ONH) Appearance examination for the confirmed diagnosis of Glaucoma. The diagnoses require regular monitoring, which is costly and time consuming. The accuracy and reliability of diagnosis is limited by the domain knowledge of different ophthalmologists. Therefore automatic diagnosis of Glaucoma attracts a lot of attention. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art of automatic extraction of anatomical features from retinal images to assist early diagnosis of the Glaucoma. We have conducted critical evaluation of the existing automatic extraction methods based on features including Optic Cup to Disc Ratio (CDR), Retinal Nerve Fibre Layer (RNFL), Peripapillary Atrophy (PPA), Neuroretinal Rim Notching, Vasculature Shift, etc., which adds value on efficient feature extraction related to Glaucoma diagnosis.}

abstract = {Many organizations source administrative business services like information technology, human resources, procurement, legal, financial and accounting services through external service providers, a practice known as Business Services Outsourcing (BSO). Many of these relationships are strategic, in the sense that they are large, underpin clients’ business strategies, and the client can become highly dependent on service provider capabilities and performance. The BSO market is over $1trillion in size and has been growing for two decades. Despite the size and maturity, up to 50% of BSO relationships result in poor outcomes, partly because partners cannot resolve conflicts. Based on interviews with client and provider leads from 13 BSO relationships, we answered the research question: “What types of inter-organizational conflicts arise in BSO relationships and how do partners resolve them?” We extended the prior literature on inter-organizational conflict frameworks by conceptualizing three types of conflicts specific to BSO: commercial conflicts, service conflicts, and relationship conflicts. Conflicts as we study them here are not minor disagreements, but have a strategic dimension. Commercial conflicts were the most serious because outsourcing relationships are firstly commercial transactions—a provider must earn a profit and a client must meet its economic business case to be viable. Theoretically, we found Thomas and Kilmann’s typology of conflict resolution styles to be robust enough to characterize the BSO conflict cases, provided a switched style category was included. In our data, we found that only the collaborative and switched-to-collaborative styles resolved conflicts to the satisfaction of both partners, which is consistent with theory. Novel findings that extend or contest prior theory are identified as part of a future research agenda. For practitioners, we also identified five effective conflict resolution behaviors.}

Therefore, developing scenarios for future maintenance is needed to define long-term strategies for the realisation of digitalised manufacturing. This empirical Delphi-based scenario planning study is the first within the maintenance realm, examining a total of 34 projections about potential changes to the internal and external environment of maintenance organisations, considering both hard (technological) and soft (social) dimensions. The paper describes a probable future of maintenance organisations in digitalised manufacturing in the year 2030, based on an extensive three-round Delphi survey with 25 maintenance experts at strategic level from the largest companies within the Swedish manufacturing industry. In particular, the study contributes with development of probable as well as wildcard scenarios for future maintenance. This includes e.g. advancement of data analytics, increased emphasis on education and training, novel principles for maintenance planning with a systems perspective, and stronger environmental legislation and standards. The scenarios may serve as direct input to strategic development in industrial maintenance organisations and are expected to substantially improve preparedness to the changes brought by digitalised manufacturing.}

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the twenty years’ research and development works for digital audio watermarking, based on an exhaustive literature survey and careful selections of representative solutions. We generally classify the existing designs into time domain and transform domain methods, and relate all the reviewed works using two generic watermark embedding equations in the two domains. The most important designing criteria, i.e., imperceptibility and robustness, are thoroughly reviewed. For imperceptibility, the existing measurement and control approaches are classified into heuristic and analytical types, followed by intensive analysis and discussions. Then, we investigate the robustness of the existing solutions against a wide range of critical attacks categorized into basic, desynchronization, and replacement attacks, respectively. This reveals current challenges in developing a global solution robust against all the attacks considered in this paper. Some remaining problems as well as research potentials for better system designs are also discussed. In addition, audio watermarking applications in terms of US patents and commercialized solutions are reviewed. This paper serves as a comprehensive tutorial for interested readers to gain a historical, technical, and also commercial view of digital audio watermarking.}

abstract = {How do the discourses of participation inform deployment of information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D)? Discourses here mean narratives that assign roles to actors, and specify causes and outcomes for events. Based on the theory and practice of international development we identify two dimensions to participation and ICT4D: whether participation 1) is hierarchical/top-down or agent-driven/bottom-up, and 2) involves conflict or cooperation. Based on these dimensions we articulate four ideal types of discourse that permeate ICT and development efforts: stakeholder-based discourses that emphasize consensus, networked efforts among actors collaborating in network arrangements, mobilization discourses that account for contestation over meanings of participation, and oppositional discourses from ׳grassroots׳ actors that also include conflict. We conclude that ICT4D efforts, depending on the context of their implementation, are permeated by multiple discourses about participation. Our four ideal types of participation discourses are, therefore, useful starting points to discuss the intricate dynamics of participation in ICT4D projects.}

abstract = {Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) concepts have been proven to enhance community activities while reducing crime problems and are fundamental to traditional law enforcement values, in terms of helping the community to function properly. The seven overlapping strategies of CPTED are discussed. The questions that are to be answered during a CPTED assessment are listed. The benefits of CPTED planning, in addition to dealing with the reduction of crime and fear problems, are listed. There needs to be the right mix of people and technology for the overall security plan to be effective. Therefore, the role of access control and video surveillance in preventing crime is discussed. The authors discuss extensively about soft targets and the role of target-hardening in reducing crime. A security checklist, including 35 security checkpoints, to assist in risk assessment is provided. The role of physical security in health care environment is described. Lighting is the single most cost-effective deterrent to crime. Hence, the types of lighting, their sources, and goals are reviewed. Special attention is paid to the subject of active shooter/active assailant and how one should respond when an active shooter is in the vicinity. The authors have also provided a classification of fires and the selection of extinguishers based on the type of fire. Fraudulent activity is an issue for individuals and all types of business operations from the small mom-and-pop store to the large Fortune 50 operation. The goal of those initiating and committing the fraudulent activity is to gain some type of monetary benefit. The goal of the targeted operation is to identify the threat and to educate their associates to identify and to eventually block the threat. Therefore the authors have discussed the top ten fraud-related issues present today.}

This article presents a novel approach to triage for digital forensics. Case-Based Reasoning Forensic Triager (CBR-FT) is a method for collecting and reusing past digital forensic investigation information in order to highlight likely evidential areas on a suspect operating system, thereby helping an investigator to decide where to search for evidence. The CBR-FT framework is discussed and the results of twenty test triage examinations are presented. CBR-FT has been shown to be a more effective method of triage when compared to a practitioner using a leading commercial application.}

Two types of cyber-interpersonal violence are examined: Cyber-harassment (including cyber-sexual harassment) and cyber-impersonation. Using Choi's (2008) integrated theory of Cyber-Routine Activities Theory, a sample of 272 college students at a Massachusetts university are examined. Three major findings are revealed: (1) Respondents who engage in risky online leisure activities are more likely to experience interpersonal violence in cyberspace, (2) poor online security management can contribute to the likelihood of being victimized by interpersonal violence on social networking sites (SNS), and (3) respondents who engage in risky social networking site activities are likely to commit cyber-interpersonal violence. For the two types of cyber-interpersonal violence examined in this study, it could also be predicted that females are more likely to have higher levels of victimization. Cybersecurity management and sex had no significant effects on cyber-interpersonal violence offending. The hope is that education on the potential hazards of the Internet and of cyber-interpersonal violence will induce more responsible online activity and engagement.}

The article proceeds with a review and critical examination of two approaches that could augment or possibly replace the traditional approach under conditions of dynamic competition—the theory of platform markets and systems approaches. Both frameworks model aspects of competition in interconnected systems in more detail and offer novel insights to inform communications policy in an era of continuous change. Nonetheless, important theoretical and implementation gaps remain that will require additional efforts by researchers and practitioners.}

abstract = {Against the backdrop of broader social changes, social media has developed rapidly in China, which has pushed the transition of the media environment from a traditional authority-dominated one to a modern media society. In particular, the use of social media by Chinese Dama can be perceived as an exemplar of media-driven social change. ‘Chinese Dama’ is a buzzword coined in tandem with the development of social media since 2013. This term represents a particular group of middle-aged Chinese women who reflect a distinctive social phenomenon in China. It is noteworthy that a growing number of Chinese Dama are learning to use social media and have established thousands of social media communities, exerting significant influence on the wider media and social environment. This study focuses on the major changes undergone by Dama, transitioning from being passively covered by media to becoming active users of social media, and this research analyzes the motivations and hallmarks of their social media activity. Although the use of social media by Chinese Dama, the traditional nucleus of Chinese society, has contributed to narrowing the digital divide and resulted in the Dama’s gaining more discourse power and ushered in new diverse lifestyles, we argue that the Dama also exert a far-reaching positive and negative influence on society, pushing for the modernization transformation of the Chinese society.}

abstract = {In this paper we comprehensively survey the concept and strategies for building a resilient and integrated cyber–physical system (CPS). Here resilience refers to a 3S-oriented design, that is, stability, security, and systematicness: Stability means the CPS can achieve a stable sensing-actuation close-loop control even though the inputs (sensing data) have noise or attacks; Security means that the system can overcome the cyber–physical interaction attacks; and Systematicness means that the system has a seamless integration of sensors and actuators. We will also explain the CPS modeling issues since they serve as the basics of 3S design. We will use two detailed examples from our achieved projects to explain how to achieve arobust, systematic CPS design: Case study 1 is on the design of a rehabilitation system with cyber (sensors) and physical (robots) integration. Case Study 2 is on the implantable medical device design. It illustrates the nature of CPS security principle. The dominant feature of this survey is that it has both principle discussions and practical cyber–physical coupling design.}

abstract = {This chapter describes the nature of asymmetric warfare on the Internet and how online deception plays a key role in psychological operations by both nation states and non-nation state actors. The role that the cyber domain plays in nationalism and nation state espionage is discussed and in particular China is held up as an example of how these concepts have evolved with the widespread use of the Internet. The role that the Internet plays in cover and concealment for non-nation state actors and their associated malicious online acts is also covered. Cyberwar at the nation state level is examined, and some of the unique characteristics of the concept of cyberwar are detailed. The chapter concludes with a look into the future of cyberwar and how relationships between non-nation state actors and nation states may change the face of hybrid conflict.}

abstract = {Information security has traditionally been about protection of electronic data, services, and systems. Cyber security, while often used interchangeably with information security, extends far beyond the protection of computer systems. Critical infrastructure systems such as water, power, heating and air conditioning, and communications, including mobile devices, all rely upon computers systems and make up the larger focus of cyber security. This chapter shows how information security has become a facet of the broader scope: cyber security. This chapter provides an introduction to many aspects of cyber security to establish a foundation for future research and study.}
