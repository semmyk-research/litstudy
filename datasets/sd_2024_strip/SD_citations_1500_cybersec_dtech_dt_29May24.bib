abstract = {Electrical networks are designed to meet the objective of guaranteeing the delivery of electricity to consumers. However, there are usually obstacles to the connection of self-produced electric power to existing networks, considering vulnerability to natural disasters and physical attacks, and even the increased use of digital technology, making networks vulnerable to cyberattacks. Therefore the modernization of electrical networks is necessary to guarantee reliability, security (including physical security), efficiency, and reduced impact concerning increased access to renewable energy sources, reduction in the impact of energy generation through nonrenewable resources, and consumer awareness to reduce waste. Thus a microgrid working as a local energy system capable of producing and potentially storing and distributing electrical energy to installations within the network is defined by integrating several distributed generation resources, energy, and load storage in a small system that is capable of operating connected to the main network. In case of emergencies or scheduled events, the microgrid may need to operate in isolation, controlling the frequency and tension and providing conditions for recovery and black start actions, influencing the expansion planning of the distribution systems, how these systems operate, and the energy analysis. This chapter aims to provide an updated overview of various microgrid concepts for residential systems and rural electrification as well as technologies, showing the fundamentals of this disruptive technology. The chapter discusses microgrid architectures for residential systems and rural electrification and hybrid microgrids and even microgrid standards, with a brief bibliographic background, and discusses the potential of microgrid technologies.}

The objective of this chapter is to better understand the complexity of SC digitalization and gain greater insights into its dynamics. We combine a historical overview of the evolving process of SC digitalization in the industry with the analysis of a specific case: one car manufacturer's ongoing SC digitalization journey. The evolution of automotive SCs and their digitalization falls into five main historical eras. Digitalization has an impact on all SC management processes from the design of cars to their end-of-life. It is a complex, multifactor, multilayer, and multiactor coevolving process. Digital technologies are a major factor of change but are also combining with other macro trends in the sector. Today's automotive sector has become a complex ecosystem with new players and stakeholders. External factors interact with SC digitalization strategies, resulting in multiple projects involving heterogeneous stakeholders. We highlight the complexity of the decision-making processes on whether to adopt specific technologies, and the strategic, organizational, and operational challenges they bring. We note the changes affecting the future of mobility solutions, which in turn will affect SC digitalization in the sector.}

Data is more and more accessible, potentially allowing making better decisions at all levels of the company. Job profiles are then changing and requiring new skills, more focused on new technologies and information systems. The most effective way to acquire necessary skills is a “learning by doing” way in industrial projects and processes. The learning factory FleXtory was designed and produced in this objective and at the crossroad of the academic and the industrial environment. It allows running combinations of theoretical and applied tools in the context of industry 4.0. This is based on interactive loops between the real and the virtual world passing through the digital twin of the learning factory. The pedagogical modules developed within this learning factory address the evolution of professional competencies and skills in according to the transition to industry 4.0. This transformation supposes the development of the ability for professionals to work within a digital environment. In this paper we propose an architecture model of FleXtory favoring the return on experience/information loop within the digital transformation of the learning factory. The originality of our work is to consider this architecture from the point of view of the pedagogical specifications of the proposed learning models and the future perspective of their use.}

Most of them use this technology for its secure, cost-effective, and transparent features such as tamper-proof data structure, abolition of a third party, decentralized data management, data tracking, data integrity, authentication, authorization, transparent data exchange, etc. IoT-aided smart grids suffer from many vulnerabilities such as hacking and malicious attacks on grids, attacks on authenticity and authorization, insecure payment schemes, and no compliance monitoring. Blockchain technology solves some vulnerabilities, i.e., authentication can be done by public-private encryption with key access, which restricts the anonymous entry of intruders. All the transactions are recorded in an immutable format and decentralization makes the data exchanges transparent for all parties who are involved in this platform. This entire platform itself acts as a validator, which performs the transaction compliance monitoring and thus abolishes the third-party intervention and makes the system cost-efficient. Blockchain technology solves insecure payment vulnerabilities by creating wallets. In the case of energy trading, this technology performs a vital role to deploy the smart contracts, a negotiable software package code module to the underlying architecture, which controls the user access, validation for impure contracts, and thus provides the automation, transactional as well as contractual security. The main contribution of this work lies in a comparative study of IoT-aided smart grid management, control, and security, energy trading, payment schemes. This study shall help an end user to learn about how blockchain technology is the best fit for different use cases of IoT-aided smart grids.}

abstract = {The current world population is 7.8 billion and is projected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050. The limited land area and strong need to produce more crop to feed the ever-increasing population is a major challenge today, especially for developing countries. The strong need to produce more crop from lesser land has led to several challenges in the field of agriculture. Reduction in agriculture yield due to climate change and global warming due to farming has become a vicious circle. Excessive use of chemicals in farms to increase soil fertility and reduce weeds and pests have adversely affected the environment and the human health. There is limited availability of natural resources like phosphorous and energy required in agriculture. Water scarcity and increase in plant diseases are other major concerns. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising technology in digital agriculture. Digital agriculture relates to using digital technologies for collecting, storing, and further analyzing the electronic agricultural data for better reasoning and decision-making using AI techniques. Precision agriculture is one such technique that monitors soil moisture and composition, temperature, and humidity and determines optimized fertilizer and water requirements for a specific crop and different areas of a farm. Then there are computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect diseases and deficiencies in plants, recognizing weeds that helps in spraying only those parts of land where the plants are disease-infected or where weeds are present instead of the whole field. Utilization of AI in agriculture is helping in developing agricultural methods capable of increasing crop yield and reducing the previously stated challenges. With merits of using AI, there are certain issues. The first major issue in using the AI techniques is the need for high computational power that, again, leads to global warming. Also, in developing countries, the internet infrastructure needs to be improved to use AI techniques effectively. Cost of using AI is high, and countries need AI experts to use the techniques to full potential. The focus of this chapter is to review how AI techniques are helping in increasing yield and overcoming limitations, like global warming, excessive use of fertilizers, limited availability of natural resources, plant disease, and water scarcity. The chapter concludes by discussing the issues and challenges in using AI, especially as it related to agriculture.}

Nevertheless, access to technology is not universal. Barriers exist even in the most advanced economies. Also, the technology itself must be conceived to be inclusive and should not create new barriers nor enhance existing ones, such as language, age, or mobility. Literature shows that digital technology brings new risks in terms of misinformation, cyber-fraud, and cyber-bullying.

So, it is fundamental to assess their ability to estimate meals’ carbohydrate content and, if needed, recommend carbohydrate counting training. In this context, we propose a personalized data-driven approach to monitor the patients’ ability to estimate the carbohydrate content of meals. The proposed approach uses personalized data to compute a safe range for the carbohydrate counting error according to the characteristics of each patient and adjust this interval to the patient's daily routines and food habits. Initially, the proposed method uses the insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio, the insulin sensitivity factor, the blood glucose limits, and the blood glucose target to compute a safe interval for the carbohydrate counting error, so the patient could train to reach this goal. Then, the app uses collected daily life data (i.e., blood glucose, meals carbohydrates content, and insulin bolus) to adjust the initial safe interval for the carbohydrate counting error according to the patient's needs. Preliminary assessment using the FDA-approved University of Virginia (UVA)/Padova Type 1 Diabetes Simulator shows the potential of the proposed approach to help type 1 diabetes patients being aware of their needs for carbohydrate counting education and how accurate they should be to achieve suitable blood glucose levels. Therefore, this tool has the potential to be a great asset to healthcare professionals and patients, improving the carbohydrate counting learning outcomes and leading to better glycemic control.}

abstract = {Microgrids operate independently of the primary energy distribution network (islands) or synchronized with the primary energy distribution network. Microgrids are small-scale electrical networks that are often powered by a combination of solar, wind, or biomass energy to provide reliable green energy, though they may use fossil fuel energy resources. Microgrids can move the energy in response to peaks and troughs in supply and demand, resulting in no interruption in the power supply. A microgrid based on a viable model of microgeneration distributed from renewable sources with energy storage and energy management system is a strategic theme that leads to breaking paradigms. This technology meets the requirement of constituting an independent electrical system configured as a kind of “energy island.” In this generation, storage and consumption can work connected to the distribution network. A microgrid design seeks to integrate distributed generation sources, such as solar photovoltaic and wind energy, more efficiently with the electric grid and improve energy quality and availability levels. Microgrids have generation units locally, based on renewable sources and energy storage units, allowing them to operate in isolation, with only local resources, or connected to the electricity grid of the company’s energy concessionaires. This chapter aims to provide an updated overview of sources of microgrids and technologies, showing the fundamentals of this disruptive technology, incorporating solar energy and energy from photovoltaic cells, with a brief bibliographic background featuring the potential of these technologies.}

We highlight factors driving the need to achieve higher levels of traceability, including regulatory demands, business incentives, and customer concerns and preferences. The emergence of global standards related to traceability is noted. The types of information required to successfully track and trace products in a digital supply chain are explained, as well as the technologies applied to collect, follow, and share information, including radio frequency identification, Internet of Things, and blockchain. The challenges around cybersecurity, standards, data quality, integrating new technologies, and potentially competing interests among stakeholders are discussed. We examine the traceability of wood products, which are important globally and raise significant sustainability challenges. The case illustrates how technical solutions can be incorporated into the traceability system to respond to the needs and challenges of stakeholders. Further research is needed on the technical, policy, and business strategy solutions to address common data and technology challenges for effective traceability systems.}

Most interactions with customers and employees have to take place in a contactless or virtual way. As such, digital operation is the way to remain in business through mandatory shutdowns and restricted activity. To that end, this paper presents a literature review on the acceleration of the digital transformation triggered by COVID-19 as a catalyst in the utilization of Industry 4.0 technologies. Furthermore, a conceptual framework for digital transformation and Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) business models change is proposed.}

Dynamic changes are transforming the insurance sector. Insurance market leaders who look boldly into the future have not resorted to observation alone and they take actions that allow them to be more customer-oriented, improve their offers, and increase operational efficiency. The aim of this article is to present the digitization processes taking place in the insurance sector in the face of the crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and an attempt to answer the following research question: has digitization in the insurance sector taken the right direction and is a response to the needs of the insurance market participants (insurers, insured persons, intermediaries, etc.) as a consequence of the actual epidemic risk (Covid-19) and its consequences. In order to verify the research question and achieve the set goal, a critical analysis of the source literature, the analysis of trends and digital solutions in the insurance sector and the analysis of secondary data were performed. The study was based on data available in national and international reports, including data published by the Polish Insurance Association, OECD or the Geneva Association. The presented results of the considerations indicate that the use of new technologies and ubiquitous digitization have a great impact on customer expectations, which was particularly noticeable in the aftermath of the epidemic risk come true (Covid-19). The article highlights the changes introduced in the organization's processes (the importance of decision support systems in insurance activities), as well as supporting consumer users (the universality of social media, and the availability of speech and image recognition technology).}

This chapter investigates the role of collaboration within supply chains for the development of technologies and solutions in Industry 4.0, with a specific focus on SMEs. We explore collaboration in the digital era through three lenses: (i) Open Innovation; (ii) Social Exchange Theory; and (iii) Boundary-Spanning. We show how horizontal and vertical collaboration in supply chains support Industry 4.0 technology development and explain how these relationships can create innovation ecosystems for Industry 4.0 solution development. We base our findings on a longitudinal study of a Brazilian ecosystem. We mapped the relationships and technologies offered by 87 SMEs and interviewed 37 stakeholders of this ecosystem. We also followed a testbed project for 2.5years to collect observational data and interviewed 40 enterprises. We discuss how relationships evolve in an innovation ecosystem oriented to Industry 4.0 technology solution provision and how technology platforms emerge within the ecosystem. The findings show how collaboration in such ecosystems can support technology development for SMEs in the Industry 4.0 context. Based on the findings we present a three-stage collaboration model to support SME engagement in Industry 4.0.}

abstract = {The raison d'être for this article is simple: traditional ways of researching, theorizing, and practicing purchasing and supply management (PSM) are no longer sufficient to ‘meet the moment’. Scholars need to advance a “business-not-as-usual” footing approach to their work, if they are to make a meaningful contribution to addressing the current and future emergencies, as highlighted by recent extreme weather and the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, what can this, or should this, mean for a field rooted in traditional business thinking? This article builds on the Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management's (JPSM) 25th Anniversary Special Issue editorial (2019); members of the JPSM's editorial team advance their unique perspectives on what “business-not-as-usual” means for PSM. Specifically, we advocate both thinking much more widely, in scope and ambition, than we currently do, and simultaneously building our ability to comprehend supply chains in a more nuanced and granular way. We explore whether the bias toward positivist work has omitted potentially interesting findings, and viewpoints. This leads to a call to re-think how we approach our work: should the key criteria always be to focus on theory development or testing? Should academics “think bigger”? Turning to specific research themes, illustrations of how our current thinking can be challenged or broadened by addressing the circular economy, and role of purchasing and innovation. Specifically, the focus on the PSM function as an intrapreneur within the larger organization, and the role of innovation and technology in PSM work. Taken together, we hope the ideas and arguments presented here will inform and inspire ambitious and novel approaches to PSM research with significant and enduring impact on the transformation of business.}

Digitally supported procurement has developed in tandem with the widespread adoption and deployment of ERP technology. Digital procurement has accelerated with the increased digital capabilities now available in contemporary organizations. Current digital procurement systems enable the automation of repeatable Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) processes. Improvements in digital technology are also supporting some strategic sourcing activities such as spend management, supplier selection, and category strategy development. These are helping to incorporate Source-to-Pay (S2P) functionality into digital procurement systems. A case study shows how digital procurement has supported a large complex tendering process in the rail industry. We look ahead to examine how future digital procurement systems may drive significant changes in the procurement landscape. The next generation of digital procurement systems will be boosted by the capture of reliable data in real-time, enhanced Data Analytics, Cognitive Analytics driven by advanced machine learning algorithms, and developments such as Artificial Intelligence and 5G enabling remote viewing. We note that research on digital procurement has focused on adoption and implementation, mirroring previous studies on technology acceptance and adoption. There are significant research opportunities to examine more fundamentally how digital procurement will change the procurement discipline.}

Essentially, this model assumes that the objectives and allocated resources are related to the cost, quality, and delivery criteria under efficiency, relevance, and effectiveness constraints. However, the scope of this model is currently questioned due to the development of the Industry 4.0 initiative and the emerging risks for the human wellbeing and the society, basically since it could be extended to current needs. Industry 4.0, where digital transformations, smart systems and a profusion of data are given place, would offer scenarios in which the company, human and society sustainability can be threatened. Therefore, including the ethical notion on the use of the technological advances is considered fundamental against potential risk, such as data privacy mismanagement, surveillance policies, discrimination, and automated judgement. As a first step of the inclusion of ethics in the industrial performance management, this paper focuses on the basic elements of the performance model that are the objectives, the means or resources, and the results of the performance management. For this, it introduces a set of requirements that defines the ethical awareness of basic elements. The methodological approach taken on this study is an explorative and interpretative research, constructed collectively by a set of researchers and industrial practitioners, based on previous works on ethics. This set of requirements will serve as a benchmark framework enabling companies to compare their performance from an ethical-aware perspective and launch plan of actions to reach the proposed standards.}

This is not only a technological change but a cultural change requiring organizational, process and economic improvement. Scientific research proved that 84% of digital transformations fail or achieve targets below expectations. Consistent with this issue, companies should address the need to implement a digital process, self-evaluating the readiness level for digital transformation. In this regard, the paper aims to develop a model that evaluates the organisations’ readiness to implement digital transformation according to I4.0 targets. For this purpose, the model adopts an online survey of 38 questions to identify the readiness degree according to a five-level scale. The survey was submitted to a sample of companies operating in different sectors. The works’ results show the model’s reliability to provide the readiness level for digital transformation and allows a preliminary evaluation of the companies’ aspects most impactful on digital transformation implementation.}

The evolution originated with Healthcare 1.0, which was doctor centric, and was subsequently followed by Healthcare 2.0 where manual records were made digital, and Healthcare 3.0 in which the technology became patient centric. Next, Healthcare 4.0 was equipped with advanced digital technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, and fog computing for sharing or communicating the data between various stakeholders such as doctors, patients, laboratories, nurses, relatives/caretakers, etc. As communication became easy and in real time in Healthcare 4.0, it utilizes a centralized architecture suffering from major issues such as access control mechanisms, security, and privacy. Majorally, the challenges include a longer time in retrieval and storage of data from heterogeneous devices as well as threats of tampering of sensitive medical records of patients/hospitals. The issue related to the access control mechanism can be resolved by 5G healthcare, which introduces a high data speed, low latency, increased reliability, availability, and massive network capacity in the current healthcare framework. In addition, the concerns of privacy and security can be resolved by adopting Blockchain technology in 5G healthcare. This emerging technology supports both the privacy and security of sensitive data by offering a safe and trustworthy secure system to record and share these data. The data, once encrypted using this technology, cannot be modified later. Thus, Blockchain is an appropriate alternative to resolve tampering issues and achieving privacy, security, and trust in applications related to healthcare. Therefore, in this chapter, the basic architecture and main features of Blockchain and 5G are introduced with the major issues faced by the healthcare industry. In addition, the adoption and importance of Blockchain with 5G healthcare is discussed in detail along with its architecture and opportunities. Further, the opportunities, scope, issues, limitations, and research directions of 5G healthcare using Blockchain with a variety of use case scenarios and case studies/applications are explored that help researchers and developers understand its importance and applicability in the healthcare domain.}

Insights in understanding critical growth drivers of innovation are essential for industrial development and economic growth for competitive advantage. This study identifies indicators from the world's major indexes and industry-level concerns. The indicators are mapped to these concerns using expert opinions and then treated mathematically using technique of order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS). This mapping ranks and identifies the most favorable indicators for several concerns. It, thus, identifies the critical role the indicators play for the drivers to the most effective advantage using the TOPSIS method as a comprehensive ranking of indicators effectively facilitates decision-making for estimated levels. The method highlights are as follows: • The most prevailing indicators for innovation are considered from the major innovation indexes for industries for mapping with concerns within the industry. • Industry-specific concerns for the pharmaceutical industry are selected for the study. • The mapping of indicators to concerns using expert opinion and using the TOPSIS method generated a matrix of the ranked indicators, aids in prioritizing resources and existing knowledge to resolve the concerns.}

We analyze sustainability in the digital supply chain by combining the supply chain SCOR model with the triple bottom line sustainability perspective that incorporates economic, environmental, and social dimensions. The complexities and trade-offs among these factors can lead to unintended consequences for sustainability initiatives. We consider two illustrative case studies: the emerging supply chains for electric passenger vehicles and the beef supply chain. Automotive and agricultural supply chains have to deal with substantial and complex sustainability issues. We identify how digital technologies may support sustainability initiatives or create unintended negative consequences. We draw insights from the two cases to discuss important issues and questions for both research and practice. Given the importance of sustainability, we highlight the need to consider carefully all the consequences of applying digital technologies in order to achieve intended benefits and reduce unintended harm.}

One reason for this delay is assumed to be that the initial efforts were mainly on business and service when design was an afterthought. The promising digital technologies that have become easily implementable in practice will in the next years facilitate design and implementation of IPS² smartly to satisfy users and contribute to sustainability. This keynote analyses literature and practice in the last decade, aiming to propose the main characteristics of IPS² of the future and design processes adequate for IPS². The design process of both production systems for sustainability and high-value systems for sustainable development goals may need to be supported differently than today.

Simulation is an indispensable set of technological tools and methods for the successful implementation of digital manufacturing, since it allows for the experimentation and validation of product, process, and system design and configuration. The value of simulation is evident, especially in today’s volatile manufacturing environment, which is influenced by globalization and ever-increasing demands for higher levels of product customization and personalization. Moreover, a significant manufacturing issue is the interoperability and communication among the several simulation tools. To that end, an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) framework for simulation and visualization of selected monitored values based on Mixed Reality (MR) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in a cloud-computing environment for intuitive data visualization on smart devices is presented in this paper. As such, in light of the possibilities offered by digital technologies such as CFD simulation, smart factories can gain a competitive advantage because of the low cost, low risk, and the provided useful insights. The range of CFD applications encountered in process manufacturing and engineering varies greatly depending on the industry. Summarizing, this review paper identifies the gaps in current practices, and future trends and challenges to be met on the field are outlined. The contribution of the research work extends to the proposal of a workflow for the integration of Mixed Reality (MR) to the CFD simulation, in an attempt to create simulation holograms on the user’s field of view.}

However, with the exponential growth in global energy demand, the energy demand–supply gap has widened at an unprecedented rate. The energy sector and the environment are directly interrelated, and one is greatly affected by a slight change in the other. The human race is also witnessing repercussions from overexploiting limited fossil fuel reserves in various forms: pollution, global warming/climate change, biodiversity loss, socioeconomic issues, etc. Therefore, now is the right and high time to transform the fossil fuel-based energy sector into one based on renewable resources (solar, wind, geothermal, tidal, biomass, etc.). To achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and the 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement, the international community should collectively and continuously attempt to increase the share of renewable resources in global energy production. The present chapter gives a comprehensive account of the past, present, and future of renewable energy and its role in sustainable development.

Fast urbanization, persistent lessening of limited resources, and occupants’ expectations of building capabilities are driving the need for the deployment of intelligent data-driven solutions. This in turn takes a step beyond delivering insights toward achieving optimized decision-making based on artificial intelligence and machine learning to universal design platforms such as building information modeling and digital twin. Integration of architecture, engineering, and building science with digital sustainability happens on a contributory intensity where intelligence is correlated with making the design and construction process more efficient. A critical consideration in this chapter is the consolidation of all aspects of digitization into one operational model. This is where digital sustainability with a human-cyber-physical scenario comes in to enhance performance and improve living conditions in the built environment. The applicability of intelligent technologies that incorporate distributed sensing and big data addresses characteristics like energy efficiency and heathy living. The chapter concludes with possible solutions for a safe and secure scenario, with the employment of blockchain technology as a measure to fortify and control the design and operation tools.}

abstract = {A majority of digital media in today's age is consumed over the internet. Any digital content uploaded online is extremely vulnerable to leakage through piracy, illegal spread, and sharing of digital copies of files to users who have not paid for the content's consumption. Many times, authentication of content to trace its source of spread fails due to the anonymity of said source. The current system of centralized content distribution networks working in conjunction with digital rights management systems to provide and authenticate users consuming digital content is faulty and can be replaced with a far more robust peer-to-peer system that operates on blockchain technology. Such a system would benefit consumers since content will no longer be held by a centralized server but rather be decentralized geographically, ensuring availability through physical hindrances such as natural disasters or digital blockages such as distributed denial of service attacks, etc. The system will also help digital content creators of various fields such as photography and music by providing the ability to detect exact points of content breaches as well as maintaining a chain of transactions in case needed in a future investigation.}

The work allows to solve the evidence of the existence of business pressures to a significant percentage of accountants. This situation is frequently presented in most cases by the owners of the companies and have led to actions outside the ethical principles and to generate moral conflict in the public accountant. This assessment is relevant to accounting by becoming a point of reflection on the situation facing the public accountant in his work exercise from pressure to violate his ethical principles. It allows to analyze how the fourth industrial revolution can be a positive mechanism to reduce these pressures by becoming a mechanism for controlling figures and in the transparency of financial information. A literature review is carried out on accounting ethics and the fourth industrial revolution. Following this, a survey, prepared as an instrument to evaluate the environment and perception of the Colombian public accountant thinking about the ethics and transformation that it would have with the developments of the fourth industrial revolution, is analyzed. Accounting ethics as evaluated are based on significant technological advances, which are no strangers to accounting work. Industrial transformation requires much more from these professionals if they do not want to be affected by automation.}

abstract = {Advances in information technology and sensors, efficient connectivity, and ground-breaking computational ability are proving to be game-changer for improving maintenance strategies and production outcomes. The integration of conventional maintenance concepts with disruptive technological developments leads to significant changes in current maintenance practices in a response to the digitalized context requirements. However, despite the availability of technology and its relative affordability, many maintenance digital transformation (MDT) initiatives fail to accomplish their goals. This is due to the fact that technology alone is not sufficient for an organization to successfully digitalize its operations. Several challenges including the absence of a business case, limited analytical capabilities, uncertainties about new technologies, and impact of the human factor are hindering the success of attempted MDT efforts. MDT enablers reflect various aspects and span different implicated areas of the organization. This study seeks to develop a comprehensive and structured list of the underpinning factors driving the success of MDT. To that end, the authors conducted a systematic literature review in order to extract the various factors highlighted in the literature. Subsequently, a purification phase was conducted which consisted of merging the redundant factors together, then mapping them into various thematic categories based on the aspect covered. The final consolidated list comprises 63 enablers of MDT that are classified into 14 categories. This research enriches the extant relevant literature and provides guidance to practitioners in this field.}

abstract = {Reconfigurable Pilot Lines (RPLs) are one practical concept for implementing the test-before-invest strategy to improve skills and capabilities of European small and medium enterprises (SMEs). SMEs typically have limited resources for systematically exploring the potential benefits of available technologies. By utilizing the RPLs offered by research institutes and universities, companies can get both commercially uncommitted and realistic proof-of-concept studies for their applications, and valuable information about the skills and personnel competences needed for successful implementation of the new technologies. Test-before-invest services offered by RPLs can also foster the process of adopting new digital technologies in manufacturing industry. RPLs are versatile. RPL can act as a test bed for manufacturing company’s investment study, industry-scale product development laboratory for technology provider, as well as a platform for scientific research and education. Due to versatile roles and functions, defining pilot line requirements specifications call for systematic contribution from both industry and academia. This paper introduces a collaborative approach for defining requirements specifications for RPLs from the future technology skills development perspective. As a basis for this research, we combine results of three joined industry-academia workshops and one academic workshop with total 87 participants utilizing Affinity Wall method. This data was supplemented with an online survey for 74 companies from manufacturing industry. The analysis indicates that defining requirements specifications and development roadmaps for RPLs is a complex process, requiring multidisciplinary collaboration. Based on the analysis, a conceptual model supporting the requirements specification work is proposed in this paper. The model was applied to an existing testbed environment for further evaluation.}

abstract = {Smart healthcare systems have become smarter compared to traditional systems due to the advancement of communication technologies such as 5G and with the wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as sensors with blockchain technologies, evolving to the current trend of Healthcare 4.0. It is decided that 75% of the company will start using the blockchain concept within 2022 and the IoT adaptors are planning to implement blockchain for around 90% based on the Gartner report. Healthcare systems, which are vital for any society, store information about the patients and their diagnoses. So, it is important to secure and maintain the privacy of patient information in smart healthcare. An amalgamation of 5G, IoT, and blockchain in a smart healthcare system provides the necessary security and privacy of the data generated. 5G provides a reliable high-performance communication network with high throughput and large network coverage for data transfer. IoT provides remote patient monitoring and real-time status for quick reactions while blockchain provides the security and privacy of the data. The framework of the smart healthcare system is discussed along with comparisons of various framework models. The layer-wise security issues and applications in IoT are also discussed. A case study is discussed to provide a wide range of information about the techniques and plan used to provide security and privacy along with a comparison of the various technologies used.}

In response, a growing number of suppliers of industrial products are considering enhancing their portfolios with subscription offerings, promising value added, such as increased productivity or better predictability. Buyers will consequently have to weigh the benefits against the risks, e.g., of data security or dependence. Current literature examining subscription business models focuses on the suppliers of such offerings. There is, however, need for research that provides guidance to buyers considering, implementing and using subscription offerings for industrial products. We contribute to this subject by exploring enablers and challenges of subscription offerings for industrial products based on 16 semi-structured interviews with experts from several industries. This article provides initial insights into a buyer’s internal transformation in conjunction with subscribing, thus making it valuable to both buyers and suppliers of such models. Furthermore, we add to procurement and subscription literature by examining subscription offerings from the buyer’s point of view.}

With the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), these industries are deploying modern digital technologies, such as the industrial internet of things (IIoT), big data analytics, cloud computing, and advanced data visualization techniques (virtual/augmented/mixed reality), reinventing process data analytic platforms for the process industries. Therefore, this chapter aims to provide the reader with a comprehensive overview of process data analytic platforms built around the concept of Industry 4.0. First, it presents a brief overview of the industrial revolution followed by a high-level system architecture of a process data analytic platform. This system architecture consists of four elements: hardware and sensing layer, data management layer, application layer, and networking layer. The chapter provides a comprehensive overview of each of these elements while focussing on IIoT, data analytics and example applications that include predictive maintenance, remaining useful life estimation, process reliability assessment, and cyber-physical systems. As the physical and cyber domains of Industry 4.0 based process data analytics platforms are more integrated, the chapter presents the cyber-physical implications of such tight integration. The chapter concludes with a summary and outlook for Industry 4.0 based process data analytics platforms (PDAP).}

To increase their overall resilience against such unexpected disruptions, traditional approaches are no longer sufficient. To date, research on supply chain resilience has mainly focused on reactive responses and recovery strategies (post-disruption). Hence, the research gap addressed in this paper is that of identifying new and proactive strategies to enable pre-emptive resilience in military supply chains (pre-disruption). In this paper, the authors first provide a critical review of the pertinent literature and research conducted over the past 12 years. Following on from there, they identify new research directions for enabling pre-emptive resilience to aid military logistic planners in monitoring supply chains and strategic decision-making to maintain their resilience.}

While utility-scale wind and solar connected to transmission networks remain the dominant sources of renewable energy, unprecedented growth in the uptake of DER introduces a paradigm shift toward decentralized electricity generation that leads to significant changes in the role of traditional distribution network utilities. The second section gives an overview of grid transformation in Australia that has already embarked on the grid transformation journey. Today, one in every three houses in many suburbs in Australia (South Australia and Queensland among the highest) generates a significant portion of their daily energy from their rooftop solar system. The boom in the rooftop solar, along with expected similar trends for electric vehicles and battery storage in the near future, has created an opportunity to transform the distribution network into an intelligent grid that supports a sustainable low-carbon future while benefiting all customers by maximizing the value from DER. Grid transformation at this scale requires major regulatory reforms that are briefly discussed.}

Despite the quick shift towards digital transformation has captured the attention of both the industry and academia, very few efforts have been made to streamline useful indicators able to monitor the implementation of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies. Owing to these considerations, this paper attempts (i) to design and implement several Key Performance Indicators able to monitor the evolution of core processes that will benefit from the I4.0 technologies, and (ii) to provide an easy-to-use approach that can be implemented in practice to guide decision-makers in the diffusion, adoption, and performance evaluation of I4.0 technologies. The effectiveness and practicality of the methodology are illustrated using a case study concerning an industrial project implemented in a leading international company in the power generation industry.}

It aims to co-evolve cutting-edge models of educational delivery. This research cluster has emerged from the work of the INSYTE Centre located in the INSYTE-Cooley Research Lab (ICRL) in the Digitization Hub of the Luke Wadding Library at SETU, Waterford. Educational techniques have evolved over the past decades and these advances have not necessarily filtered down to various disciplines, e.g. engineering. The focus of this research cluster is to have the ‘Learner’ at the center of the ‘Learning Experience’ and to wrap the technology around them. This in turn, will increase the adoption and usage of such technologies. It will do this by cross-fertilization of knowledge over diverse domains to produce customised human-centred solutions for communities. Equality, diversity and inclusion are critical strands in this research. This paper shows that the European Union (EU) is supportive of changes in education required to close the skills gap in engineering and to enable reskilling to support Industry 5.0. In addition to the creation of cutting-edge models of educational delivery the vision of this multidisciplinary human centered research cluster is the establishment of a state-of-the-art pilot factory as an Irish national initiative in SETU, Waterford.}

We present further philosophical motivations for the structural details of our proposed “Syntagmatic Graph” representations and examine techniques for integrating conceptual spaces with linguistic paradigms such as Conceptual Role Semantics and situational semantics. Our central argument is that the classical linguistic concept of “thematic roles” provides an alternative framework for analyzing the semantic integration of multiple conceptual spaces, contrasted with “quantitative blend” models endemic to conceptual space theory proper. Therefore we propose “role-indexed” Conceptual Space models, which have distinct semantic and syntactic patterns, juxtaposing this theory to existing formalizations of conceptual spaces in (for example) Quantum NLP. With that natural-language foundation as a motivation, we then consider semantic models as they could be more concretely applied to scientific data sets.}

This fully digitalized, two-way communication domain furnishes substantial asset optimization and efficacy-fortuity for engaging entities. Smart-Grid uses digital technologies and IoT-solutions to wisely respond to and transform changes in the grid. Infusing energy intelligence is the key to anchoring the data in the grid that allows grid operation to be authentic, cost-effective, pliable, and prudent. This technique can act far-flung on network events and ameliorate our supply and relationship with the territory. End-users’ privacy is a significant concern when collecting energy usage data to deploy and adopt Smart Grid technologies. Smart Grids integrate the conventional electrical power grid with Information and Communication Technologies, Intelligent Information processing and Future-Oriented Techniques. Such integration empowers the electrical-utility providers and end-users to improve the power system’s coherence and bareness while continually monitoring, controlling, and managing customers’ demands. Cyber security should be an intrinsic part of the drafting and design process involved with Smart Grid initiatives’ deployment. They are deploying a Smart Grid without ample sanctuary that might affect the outcome in severe outcomes, such as grid instability, expediency deception, user information, and energy-consumption data loss. Cyber security is a serious problem of the Smart Grid. Cyber security and data privacy questions have provided inherent keyholes since large-scale communication networks will be needed to connect numerous devices from geographically spread sites to a Control center. Organizations need to display intramural privacy policies and supporting procedures for their individual to follow to bring forth behests to effectively and consistently protect consumer and energy usage data, energy-consumption data, and energy-preferring data.

abstract = {The many potential uses and benefits of the Internet of Things (IoT) have spurred great interest from practitioners and researchers to investigate IoT applications in supply chains and logistics systems. IoT-based supply chains are enabled by technologies such as Radio Frequency Identification, Wireless Sensor Networks, Machine-to-Machine systems, and mobile apps. IoT may allow reduced human intervention in decision-making processes through controlling, optimizing, planning, and monitoring of the supply chain virtually. This chapter provides an overview of IoT and investigates IoT applications and challenges in the context of supply chains. Different IoT technologies are being actively trialed in a wide range of supply chain applications including cold chains, perishable products, agriculture and crops, and some manufacturing supply chains. However, the application of IoT technologies in supply chains is challenging. Security and data privacy, standards and naming services, technology adoption, and big data generation are some of the critical issues. We present a framework—the IoT Adopter—for organizations to critically assess IoT adoption and implementation in supply chain applications. The framework identifies four fundamental stages that should be considered in deploying IoT across a supply chain: adoption rate calculation, profitability computation, architecture design, and continuous improvement.}

The development of this study is part of a larger project that has to do with the design of a cold chain inventory management model through IoT, Blockchain, and Cloud Computing for SMEs in Colombia. The work carried out in this first part consisted of a proof of concept (POC) to verify the technical feasibility of Industry 4.0 technologies in the management of goods in the last-mile urban distribution process in the cold chain. We assemble sensors in a portable device to measure control variables in the cold chain, develop the software that supports it, and carry out tests in a controlled setting. The results validate the expected functionality of the prototype but, above all, disclose conditions that must be considered. Finally, we discuss the applicability of the proposed device in the practical world and the future challenges for the subsequent phases.}

Innovation through design is making the electricity industry experiences the same sort of rapid development as the information and communication technology industry has undergone during the past 30 years. Today, electrical utilities have the opportunity of seizing the potential of advanced communication, computing, and control technologies where smart technologies are the existing hub of innovation. To realize this fact, it is essential to integrate smartness and intelligence at all levels of the built environment infrastructure. This chapter explains how utilities and consumers are enabled to pool power from multiple plants and distributed sources to achieve high flexibility and scale by taking advantage of the smart grid capabilities. By integrating energy efficiency, distributed energy generation technologies, and demand flexibility into buildings, the state of the art in grid-interactive efficient buildings can be advanced. Such integration is feasible with the deployment of smart electrical load management strategies supported by sensor and actuator wireless networks that offer potential on the path toward Tactile Internet, Internet of Energy, smart urban mobility, net-zero energy buildings, and ultimately long-term sustainability and health.}

abstract = {Increasing digitalization in manufacturing, often associated with terms like Industry 4.0 (I4.0) or Smart Manufacturing, is a topic of crucial concern for manufacturing companies. Different digital technologies (DTs) can be integrated into manufacturing processes and systems aiming at increasing flexibility, product quality or productivity. The type and scope of potential DTs must be carefully selected when planning and improving a manufacturing system. The definition and configuration could be supported by simulation techniques that assess the DTs' impact on the manufacturing system and its final performance. However, parametrizing the DTs into a simulation tool is not straightforward since appropriate models might be challenging to obtain and actual impacts of DTs are uncertain. Against this background, the paper presents methods to enable a simulation-based assessment while considering the impact of not just individual but also a combination of DTs. The paper introduces a framework to define the base characteristics of selected DTs within a manufacturing system and their parameterization into a commercial simulation tool. Furthermore, the usability and expectable results are demonstrated in a case study.}

A step forwards this objective is to understand and define the concept in relation to its application area, here Industry 4.0. Indeed, the concept of resilience has been studied in various fields, covering different definitions and characteristics such as the ability to anticipate, to survive and to react to exceptional situations. This paper makes a literature review of the concept of resilience and its different aspects and then position it in the Industry 4.0 context. To achieve this objective a coarse framework linking Industry 4.0 pillars and components with the different aspects of resilience (characteristics, phases and strategies) is proposed.}

The global trends that we aim to scrutinize in this chapter are the five Ds, namely, decentralization, decarbonization, digitalization, deregulation, and democratization, which will roll up the life of every human being in the near future. Interestingly, future power systems will only be considerably affected by these Giga Trends, but also play a key role to further the mentioned Giga Trends. We believe that the 5D Giga Trends will result in some new characteristics for the future power systems in such a way that the existing approaches will not be sufficient to tackle the upcoming issues. As a result, understanding the power system transformation strongly depends on investigating the impacts of the 5D Giga Trends. It is anticipated that a tsunami of disruptions will happen in the future power systems due to these 5D Giga Trends along with the introduction of innovative technologies. This chapter addresses the role of the aforementioned global trends in the future power system, investigates the challenges faced by the existing power systems, and the opportunities due to the emergence of the Giga Trends in power systems are highlighted.}

It is estimated that global losses caused by cybercrime are now exceeding $1 trillion per year (McAfee Corp. New McAfee Report estimates global cybercrime losses to exceed $1 trillion, 2020) and are expected to continue to grow for the foreseeable future. From a cybersecurity perspective, diabetes care sits at an interesting crossroads. On one hand, diabetes devices are governed by the same respective national regulators (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States) as hospital-based medical equipment. On the other hand, they are used directly by the patient as part of their daily routine and increasingly in interaction with the patient's technology environment (e.g., their smart devices or local home networks). It is understandable that users of life-sustaining health technology, like the medical devices used in diabetes care, will ask whether their devices, and therefore their personal safety, may be at risk to a cybercompromise. This section will help to provide an understanding of the current state of cybersecurity in the diabetes ecosystem and will provide a balanced discussion of the topic so that the reader can make an educated decision about the potential cyberrisks versus the medical benefits provided by technology.}

As technologies evolve, these models have to be improved as well: the aim of the paper is to update the CCMS model with AI aspects that were not detailed enough previously. In the paper, the authors first perform a literature review on the topic of application of AI in the production area, and also interview experts from the industry and academia in order to create a basis for the AI aspect in the CCMS model.

abstract = {With artificial intelligence (AI) impacting every aspect of our lives, it is hardly surprising that the conversation around its potential impact on urban design and master planning should be moving rapidly toward the center stage. Architecture and urban design professionals took their time to digitalize their practice relative to manufacturing and engineering, for example, so it is not unexpected that embracing AI has not been a priority concern. With outliers, not least big-tech, no longer waiting in the wings to pick off the low hanging fruit from the urban designers’ digital workbench, the professions are waking up: the possibility that AI automation of niche tasks for certain clients might prove more compelling than calling upon for planning and urban designers time-honored professional expertise. Most in the profession, however, will not have studied still less absorbed artificial intelligence within their modus operandi. What is there to stop an alternative approach to urban design expertise from emerging, one which hybridizes and automates the finding of insights from rapidly expanding data sources displacing reliance on a lifetime of professional know-how? Key constituents of planning, social science, urban design, engineering, and computer science expertise lend themselves to being algorithmized. Their respective custodians need to be vigilant against the possibility of their human skills being supplanted by new “smart” digital tools. Fortunately, for the urban futures professions most at threat, there is a potential alternative bright future for those who can meld their creative skills with the smarts that a working knowledge of AI can bring to urban design. With relatively few designers learning the rudiments of AI, let alone learning how to deploy it, there is a risk that they assume AI has no place in creative practice. This could be matched by AI experts blithely assuming they can develop tools without appreciating the subtleties creatives bring to problem-solving: balancing the pros and cons of diverse options (the design approach) as opposed to homing in on the solution (the engineering approach). This brief chapter seeks to introduce a new agenda for addressing the divide between planning and urban design on one side of a yawning chasm, by bridging across to AI on the other. The core premise is fundamentally shifting urban development toward meaningful citizen participation within the planning and urban design processes leading to more sustainable and resilient future urban environments. Firstly, I will succinctly set the scene with some prognostications on the future of work to presage a positive perspective to the increasing automation of time-honored practices. For readers not especially familiar with AI, I have assembled a catalogue raisonné of 26 AI components such as “machine learning” and “pattern recognition” with a view to explicating the potential value of each within the digital urbanist's digital toolset. I follow this by describing an AI-enhanced alternative workflow for the professional planner and urban designer. It is hypothetical now given the contemporary constraints; the alternative workflow presumes that the current rapid advances in AI will continue. The alternative workflow speculates on how practice might profit (rather than suffer) from the transformative marvels that AI can bring to design when fully embraced. I conclude with some notes and a warning around the vexed issue of “expertise”: what are the risks and benefits of embracing AI within urban design in a world increasingly distrustful of human expertise, let alone robots?}
