abstract = {This paper studies the implementation of twin transition, i.e., the combination of digital technologies and European Green Deal goals, to achieve sustainable solutions supporting the creation of impactful, net-zero carbon and a resilient built environment with a focus on Northern Europe, specifically Finland. The subject was examined from policies, technology and market perspectives. Numerous European regulations and policies are driving the twin transition since many of them include obligatory requirements for the member states. Technologies and technology combinations exist to support the twin transition in the Nordic built environment. It was assessed that energy technologies are the most important and control, monitoring and automation technologies are the second most important technology category for the twin transition. In addition, individual technologies’ maturity and relevance to the twin transition in the built environment in cold climates were evaluated. By analyzing case studies, it was found that the markets are not mature enough to lead the twin transition, but external boosts are needed. However, this can also be seen as an opportunity for service business. The results are focused on Northern Europe, but European legislation also supports the international SDGs.}

abstract = {Future energy systems will be more efficient because of the energy transition of which, decarbonization, decentralization, and digitalization are important aspects. In addition, cyber security becomes more important in the digitalized energy system as cyber-attacks increase. Since the Smart Energy Hub (SEH) is well known as an efficient type of smart digitalized energy system, cyber security is of great importance in SEH operation. In this paper, a novel possibilistic–probabilistic​ SEH model is proposed to evaluate the effect of cyber-attacks on the demand side of the energy system. The presented model is called Possibilistic–Probabilistic Risk-based Smart Energy Hub scheduling model considering Cyber Security in the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (PPRSEHAMICS). It contains different uncertainties regarding renewable generations, demand response programs, gas fuel, wind turbines, and energy prices. The uncertainty of demand response programs is represented using the Z-number as a possibilistic–probabilistic method. Other uncertainties are represented using a scenario-based hybrid approach and Monte Carlo Simulation. Also, the downside risk constraint (DRC) approach is used to model the behavior of the SEH operator in the presence of uncertainties, so the operation and risk costs are simultaneously optimized. Furthermore, a novel Monte Carlo-based FDI detection/correction method is proposed in order to determine and mitigate the effects of cyber-attacks. The proposed model is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem and the GAMS environment is used to solve it. In this paper, different scenarios are considered to evaluate the effects of demand response (DR) programs, SEH operator behavior, false data injection, and correction on the operation cost and risk-in-cost of smart energy hub systems. In the first stage, the obtained results demonstrate that using DR accompanied by DRC yields the optimum operation strategy where the operation cost and risk are maintained at an acceptable point. Further, simulation results suggest that FDI attacks can deviate the operation cost and risk by a substantial amount, and the proposed Monte Carlo-based detection/correction method mitigates almost 79 percent of the false data while keeping the convergence speed in an acceptable range. Moreover, modeling the participation rate of the demand response program by the Z- number approach increases the validity of the results and the applicability of the proposed model.}

abstract = {The manufacturing industry tries to innovate always to cater to customer-oriented products. The digitization of manufacturing is revolutionizing the future of this industry. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is bringing down the labor cost, reducing the machine downtime, and overall increasing the production speed. A new technological trend like Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses computer algorithms based on available data and can improve or decide further, automatically, based on experience, without the need for prior programming commands. ML can improve daily processes for identifying bottlenecks, developing products, controlling quality, providing security to the industry, and using AI robotics in place of humans. On one hand, technologies like ML, AI, IIoT, new materials, photonics, and rapid prototyping are driving the manufacturing sector in adopting a future version of Industry 4.0, and on the other hand, the European Commission (EC) has defined a roadmap until 2050 or more, in achieving the sustainable goal of carbon-neutrality and complete digitalization with resilience across the European continent. However, it is challenging to match the planned and actual roadmaps to the future of the technology-based manufacturing industry. There are uncertainties about how the future will be shaped by technologies in the EU manufacturing industry, in the changing political, environmental and social world environment. Recognizing these difficulties, the current article consults the available literature on this topic to determine the factors that will characterize the future of the manufacturing industry across EU countries. The relevant information about the EU manufacturing sectors has first been collected from various sources like Eurostat data, the EC policy documents, manufacturing company's annual reports, research reviews, journal articles, EU Industry Days annual event, etc. Then the collected data were analyzed to gain insight into the future of the technology-based EU manufacturing industry in the context of the European Commission's outlined policies. Variable factors from different manufacturing sectors are presented from different EU member states and scenario analysis was used for understanding the possible future. It is concluded that the future does not lie in adapting to the changing environment but in creating the future by EU companies themselves - revolution must be met by revolution. Their early experiences and path dependency can be seen as stubbornness, which may act as formidable barriers to building new capabilities. Therefore, companies must step-wise integrate resources to create a new process, and new structure, with personnel motivation, that fits with the broader European context in the coming decades.}

The study first conducted a content-centric literature review and identified 12 functions through which Industry 5.0 can inclusively boost sustainable manufacturing. The study further developed a strategic roadmap that identified the complex contextual relationships among the functions and explained how they should be synergistically leveraged to maximize their contribution to sustainability. Results reveal that value network integration, sustainable technology governance, sustainable business model innovation, and sustainable skill development are the most driver and tangible implications of Industry 5.0 for sustainable manufacturing. Alternatively, renewable integration and manufacturing resilience are among the most dependent and hard-to-reach sustainable functions of Industry 5.0, and their materialization requires major strategic collaboration among stakeholders. The strategic roadmap outlines how Industry 5.0 stakeholders can leverage the technological and functional constituents of this agenda to promote sustainable manufacturing inclusively.}

The review draws on a systematic selection and analysis of 131 primary sources, including peer-reviewed articles, books, and chapters published between 2016 and 2023. The analysis of the literature consistently reveals a discernible pattern: (i) a notable gap between theoretical propositions and practical implementation of Construction 4.0 technologies, processes, and strategies; (ii) a range of barriers hindering the effective adoption of this transformative paradigm such as significant upfront costs associated with integrating Construction 4.0 technologies, a shortage of skilled personnel adept in utilizing these technologies, inadequate regulatory frameworks, hesitancy among construction leadership, and a deep-seated aversion to change within the industry; and, (iii) a lack of understanding in the policy and scholarly community about the impact of Construction 4.0 on the SEGT dimensions. The article warns for unfounded technocratic optimism about Construction 4.0; calls for a holistic application of this ‘new’ paradigm and refrain from cherry-picking ‘cheap and easy’ technologies and applications; and suggests that the construction industry may be able to leapfrog the ‘4.0’ revolution and directly embrace a ‘5.0’ approach by incorporating a human-centric perspective and focusing on how technology and automation can help address the central challenges of the 21st century.}

This paper utilizes an integrated IUIPC and Privacy Calculus model to explore the impact of privacy concerns, incident response efficacy, trust, and risk involved in digital conferencing adoption. To test the proposed model, we administer a survey to 212 participants and find that perceived benefits, trusting beliefs, and personal Internet interest increase intention to use digital conferencing software while risk beliefs decrease behavioral intentions. In addition, we find incident response efficacy to be a salient construct in explaining users’ trusting beliefs. The study provides recommendations for digital conferencing service providers on how to improve consumer adoption through strengthened security practices and incident response strategies.}

We analyse the degree of academic digitalization, trying to identify the main changes in teaching methods introduced because of the COVID-19 pandemic, underlining those that could also be effective in the ‘new normal’. We developed an explorative survey for professors of Italian universities, analysed by means of PLS-SEM techniques. 286 out of 877 identified academics took part in the survey (i.e., 32.61% of the total population). Due to the nature of the results gathered, we proposed a two-level analysis. First, we implemented a syntactic analysis on the open and closed questions to emphasize the impacts that the pandemic had on instructors and academia as a whole. Second, by implementing SmartPLS procedures, we analysed in depth the quantitative data gathered. Among the main findings of our study, we observed that digitalization and distance-learning played a secondary role in influencing the organization of educational programs compared with the learning experience and its primary role in defining student performance. In short, this study represents one of the very first attempts to analyse the adoption of new teaching practices following an anomalous disruption to our daily lives (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic). It highlights the need to shift towards active learning approaches in higher education, even within a blended-learning or distance-learning environment, emphasizing a student-centred teaching method and its experientialism. This should lead – from a managerial point of view of academia – to a lower ‘churn rate’ and – from an educational standpoint for policy-makers – to a decrease in dropouts due to lack of interest and a poor learning experience.}

In this study, we develop and solve an integrated problem of procurement, production, and distribution strategies (PPDs) in a medium-scale food processing company. Using the digital twin approach, the model considers the industrial symbiosis opportunities between the supplier, manufacturer, and customer using interval and sequence variables operating in a constrained environment using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and agent-based simulation (ABS) methodology. The study optimizes the make-span and lead time, simultaneously achieving a higher level of digitalization. The analysis demonstrates how digital twin accelerates supply chain productivity by improving makespan time, data redundancy (DR), optimal scheduling plan (OSP), overall operations effectiveness (OOE), overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), and capacity utilization. Our findings provide compelling evidence that the seamless integration PPDs enormously enhance production flexibility, resulting in an excellent service level of 94 %. Managers leverage real-time simulation to accurately estimate the replenishment point with minimal lead time, ensuring optimized operations. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that implementing PPDs has yielded considerable benefits. Specifically, we observed a remarkable 65 % utilization of the pasteurizer and aging vessel and an impressive 97 % utilization of the freezer. Moreover, by applying the DT model, the present model found a notable 6 % reduction in backlog, further streamlining operations and enhancing efficiency.}

Shift from paper- to digital-based systems enable recording and reporting data directly in digital format and further analyze and disclose inspection data. Further to this, digital technologies enable the automatization of processes through rule-based instructions, a fact that could positively influence the consistency of official control. Nevertheless, the extent of the use of digital technologies during official food safety control inspections by competent authorities (CAs) of European Union (EU) countries is not known. For this reason, the aim of this study was to assess the level of use of a digital environment during inspections at retail establishments. This was performed by administering a questionnaire to CAs from EU countries. A total of 88 national, regional or local CAs from 15 EU countries responded to the questionnaire. Of them, 62.5% (55/88) used a digital environment during inspections, the majority to standardize data collection and reporting. CAs autotomize processes through digital technologies related to the management of official control and generation of inspection results, but to a lesser extent to automatize decision-making during inspections. Of the CAs not using a digital environment (37.5%; 33/88), technological constraints and lack of economic resources were the two most prevalent reasons for not using such an environment. The use of digital technologies as decision support tools to standardize official controls and improve consistency and efficiency should be enhanced for the benefit of society.}

The Singapore government has realized the enormous potential of smart FM in developing a sustainable city and has implemented several initiatives to promote its adoption. However, the adoption of smart FM in the built environment industry is still in its early stage. Therefore, this study aims to (1) investigate drivers, barriers, and strategies in the adoption of smart FM; and (2) explore whether there are significant differences in the perceived importance of the drivers, barriers, and strategies by designations and years of experience. To achieve these objectives, a comprehensive literature review was first conducted to identify 6 drivers, 13 barriers, and 10 strategies. A survey questionnaire was designed and then validated by pilot interviews to collect data from practitioners in the built environment industry. Post-survey interviews were also carried out to validate the analysis results from the questionnaire survey. The study identified that increased energy savings, improved sustainability, and reduced downtime are the three most important drivers. Poor data management, high initial cost, and high cybersecurity risks are the three most important barriers. Development of technology selection mechanisms, improvement of smart FM system, and increased amount of funding are the three most effective strategies to address the challenges. Designations and years of experience have been proved to affect the perceptions of the importance of drivers, barriers, and strategies. The findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the drivers, barriers, and strategies in the adoption of smart FM, offering a starting point for organizations to consider its adoption. This study also enriches the knowledge of smart FM in the built environment industry with the expectations of facilitating the digital transformation and sustainable development of the built environment industry.}

keywords = {Smart homes, Complex online harms, Privacy risks, Security vulnerabilities, Law, Ethics},
abstract = {Background:
Technological advances in the smart home have created new opportunities for supporting digital citizens’ well-being and facilitating their empowerment but have enabled new types of complex online harms to develop. Recent statistics have indicated that ‘smart’ technology ownership increases yearly, driven by lower costs and increased accessibility. Research on smart homes has also grown, focusing on technology perspectives at the expense of a user-centric approach sensitive to the smart home’s harms, risks, and vulnerabilities.
Objective:
This scoping review addresses the information gap by underscoring the scope of literature that exists regarding complex online harms, vulnerabilities, and risks associated with smart home technologies and citizens’ agency. The goal is to understand the state of knowledge, gaps in the literature, and areas for future study. The importance and originality of this paper lie in its interdisciplinary review and approach. It is hoped that this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of complex online harms in the smart home.
Design:
Three online databases were utilised to identify papers published between 2017 and 2022, from which we selected 235 publications written in English that addressed harms, risks, vulnerabilities, and agency in the smart home context. This allowed us to map contemporary literature to reveal significant gaps in our understanding of the complex online harms affecting smart home users and identify opportunities for further research.
Results:
This review identified emerging themes of ‘risks’, ‘vulnerabilities’, and ‘harms’ in that order of frequency within the literature on smart homes. The usage of terms is skewed towards computing science and information security, which comprised the majority of the literature at 54.6%. Human–computer interaction papers contributed 24.4%, while social sciences accounted for 16.2%.
Conclusion:
Risks, harms and vulnerabilities within smart home ecosystems and IoTs are ongoing issues with complexities that necessitate research. Privacy, security, and well-being are key themes that embody the scope of complex harms affecting smart home devices in the broad literature. This review establishes disciplinary research gaps, especially in user-centred perspectives, due to a heavy technology focus in the existing literature. Therefore, further research is needed to address emergent risks, harms and vulnerabilities of smart home devices and understand how user agency and autonomy can complement the design, interface, and socio-technical aspects of smart home systems.}

At the same time, digital solutions have proven essential in improving safety, quality of life, and resilience in daily life. However, the lower population density and the lack of digital infrastructure in such rural areas make it difficult to develop technology-driven private businesses and public services. This can negatively impact socio-economic indicators and hinder the development of new services to cover peoples’ needs. For this reason, in this document, we seek to provide a stronger focus on rural regions in digitalization efforts and create new opportunities for rural communities. For that, we analyze the barriers and needs of the rural environment and present AURORAL, a digital service platform designed to meet the needs and contexts of rural areas. This ecosystem, comprising sustainable and multi-interoperable apps and services, can help communities succeed in innovation and smart transformation, providing the necessary infrastructure to facilitate long-lasting social, environmental, and economic benefits by prioritizing openness, interoperability, and decentralization. On the principle that the full potential of these technologies can only be realized when they are integrated into societal and economic activity and organization, AURORAL aims to promote economic growth and digitalization in the rural domain and contribute to bridging the digital divide between rural and urban areas.}

In contrast, international media outlets focus on providing critical comments, criticism, and real-life events of human rights violations in the country to question and confront the law's legitimacy. The study also analyzes the competitive and tense nature of the discourses, characterized by antagonistic responses between the two media sources.}

The indications of the Digicomp framework and 21st-century skills in Europe have outlined the key competences for lifelong learning needed for all citizens, including teachers and students. In this perspective, Education plays a fundamental role in ensuring that citizens acquire the required skills. The objective in the common European framework is clear: to initiate a transition from the culture of knowledge to the culture of competence. Nowadays, technological advancement allows the researchers to create and combine different frameworks with the perspective of an even more tailored, and engaged education, some examples derived from the implementation of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), in the combination of Gamification and AI, or the development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) to foster and create an even more personalized learning and teaching. Following these premises, in this paper, we want to point out new research reflections and perspectives that could help researchers, teachers, educators (and consequently students) to reflect on the introduction of new technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, robot tutors) and on how these can affect on human behavioral development and on the acquisition of new skills and competences (Specifically: Creativity, Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, and Computational Thinking) for the educational context. The analysis carried on, suggests a perspective on how creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving can be effective in promoting computational thinking, and how Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be an aid instrument to teachers in the fostering of creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving in schools and educational contexts.}

However, model and data security may pose challenges for developing zero-defect production and other industrial manufacturing industries. To address this issue, we generate adversarial examples using a one-pixel attack in adversarial machine learning, which can fool the defect detection classification model. The traditional one-pixel attack based on the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm has limited global search ability. Therefore, we use a novel algorithm called Teaching and Learning-based Moth-Flame Optimization (TLMFO), which enhances the global search performance and improves the attack effectiveness. We evaluate TLMFO on benchmark functions and attacks on Cifar10 and ImageNet datasets, and compare it with MFO and DE. The results show that TLMFO outperforms both MFO and DE in terms of accuracy and speed of convergence. Moreover, TLMFO achieves notably better attack effectiveness than DE under targeted and untargeted attacks on the Cifar10 dataset and under-targeted attacks on the ImageNet dataset. Our research confirms that safety prevention is a link worth considering in developing Industry 5.0.}

Socially robust development and implications of AI in healthcare require urgent investigation. There is a particular dearth of studies in human-AI interaction and how this may best be configured to dependably deliver safe, effective and equitable healthcare. To address these challenges, we need to establish diverse and interdisciplinary teams equipped to develop and apply medical AI in a fair, accountable and transparent manner.

To address this gap, a set of Food Logistics 4.0 measures and a set of green measures are compared, in the scope of the carbon footprints of a national and overseas fresh apple supply chain. A method to estimate the decarbonization potential of technologies, based on secondary data and expert opinion is presented and applied. Most of the Food Logistic 4.0 bear a relatively low potential to reduce the emissions. Therefore, they need to be flanked by green measures to reach the political goals for CO2 reduction.}

The current study attempts to well envisage the ways blockchain can restructure and transform DTs to provide secure manufacturing, assuring compliance, traceability, quality, authenticity, and safety. However, to the adoption of DTs and BT in the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), there are several barriers. To identify the key barriers, the present study discusses a survey approach through comprehensive literature and interviews with experts. To do so, this study introduced a novel approach using decision-making theory under the q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS) to analyze the identified barriers. This study developed a new methodology called q-ROF-subjective and objective weight integrated approach (SOWIA)-weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS). An empirical case study to assess the barriers to employing BT into DTs for IIoT implementation in the era of Industry 4.0 is taken. Also, comparative work and sensitivity analysis are discussed to demonstrate the advantage of the presented approach.}

abstract = {The current investigation endeavors to examine Latin America, a region that exhibits poverty, uneven development, and inequality, all of which present significant challenges to the attainment of sustainable progress. The primary objective of the research is to recognize, scrutinize, and explain the factors that are necessary or sufficient for the establishment of a comprehensive democratic system in the region. To achieve this goal, the study will integrate the perspectives of e-state components and multiple stakeholders into a multi-dimensional, multi-level framework. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is acknowledged as a tool that can promote governance and citizen involvement in the public decision-making process by advancing information sharing among citizens, businesses, and governments and upgrading the delivery of public services. Although ICT cannot substitute political institutions, it can act as a catalyst for enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of political systems. Prior research suggests that ICT has not transformed political systems fundamentally; nevertheless, it has improved processes and transactions in public administration, especially in democratic states. This article utilizes Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to evaluate the combined effect of the necessary conditions for Democratic consolidation in LATAM, by investigating the components of technology and its use by individuals, businesses, and governments. By examining a sample of 18 case studies, the aim of the analysis is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the essential conditions and factors that underpin effective state management, which is considered the cornerstone of a democratic system. The conclusion presented is that in order to consolidate a democratic system, it is necessary to overhaul the fundamental structure of the system itself, starting from the inside and working towards external changes. One proposed approach involves utilizing Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as a catalyst for initiating this internal transformation. By leveraging the power of ICT, it becomes possible to effect change from within the system, which can in turn help to consolidate and enhance democratic principles, while simultaneously eradicating any existing weaknesses or failures. The results create a comprehensive, integrated approach about how to change a system from within; this involves considering not only external factors that the Theory of Democratic Consolidation requires for a strong civic society or fair elections, but also and most importantly the internal factors: How the elements of the system communicate.}

This is not surprising considering modernisation's important role in the current context of the 4th and anticipated 5th industrial revolutions. A mining company's success, competitiveness and sustainability largely hinges on its ability to proactively envision the future mine and plan an implementation pathway now rather than passively responding to its inevitable unfolding. Although the application of digital transformation has seen a slow, but steady uptake in the mining value chain, progress has largely been much slower in the stakeholder engagement space. This has been observed across the mining industry regardless of geographic location despite stakeholder engagement's central role in securing a social licence to operate. Much of the debate has focused on whether stakeholder engagement delivers a social licence to operate, and on the various stakeholder mapping and engagement frameworks. The fundamental aim of this review is to map the digital transformation of the mineral industry with a specific focus towards understanding how stakeholder engagement practices could be integrated in a mine's modernisation strategy to deliver a social licence to operate. In particular, we address: (a) the slow, but steady uptake of technology with potentially adverse effects on stakeholders, such as mining mechanisation, high underground pumping capabilities, and digital exploration; (b) how an understanding of responsible mine modernisation could influence the way the industry deploys people-centric technology for sustainability; (c) how considering stakeholder engagement as network building provides a valuable lens to understand digital transformation for social licence; (d) the promise of responsibly modernised engagement practises for the future mine; and (e) implications of responsibly modernised stakeholder engagement on skillsets of the future. Combining these topics effectively creates a stable mining network, thereby significantly reducing conflicts in mining ecosystems. Technology transformation in the mining value network will be more successful and sustainable if it does not lose sight of the need for a robust integrative stakeholder engagement approach.}

abstract = {Over the past decades, industries and governments have progressively been relying upon space data-centric and data-dependant systems. This led to the emergence of malicious activities, also known as cyber-threats, targeting such systems. To counter these threats, new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been implemented and deployed. Today, AI is highly capable of delivering fast, precise, and reliable command-and-control decision-making, as well as providing reliable vulnerability analysis using well-proven cutting-edge techniques, at least when applied to terrestrial applications. In fact, this might not yet be the case when used for space applications. AI can also play a transformative and important role in the future of space cybersecurity, and it poses questions on what to expect in the near-term future. Challenges and opportunities deriving from the adoption of AI-based solutions to achieve cybersecurity and later cyber defence objectives in both civil and military operations require rethinking of a new framework and new ethical requirements. In fact, most of these technologies are not designed to be used or to overcome challenges in space. Because of the highly contested and congested environment, as well as the highly interdisciplinary nature of threats to AI and Machine Learning (ML) technologies, including cybersecurity issues, a solid and open understanding of the technology itself is required, as well as an understanding of its multidimensional uses and approaches. This includes the definition of legal and technical frameworks, ethical dimensions and other concerns such as mission safety, national security, and technology development for future uses. The continuous endeavours to create a framework and regulate interdependent uses of combined technologies such as AI and cybersecurity to counter “new” threats require the investigation and development of “living concepts” to determine in advance the vulnerabilities of networks and AI. This paper defines a cybersecurity risk and vulnerability taxonomy to enable the future application of AI in the space security field. Moreover, it assesses to what extent a network digital twins’ simulation can still protect networks against relentless cyber-attacks in space against users and ground segments. Both concepts are applied to the case study of Earth Observation (EO) operations, which allows for conclusions to be drawn based on the business impact (reputational, environmental, and social) of a cyber malicious activity. Since AI technologies are developing on a daily basis, a regulatory framework is proposed using ethical and technical approaches for this technology and its use in space.}

We chronologically explored theoretical viewpoints, analytical frameworks, measures, relationships, and procedures from 2015 to 2022 to examine the relationship between blockchain technology and environmental sustainability. We followed a four-step methodology (planning, execution, analysis, and reporting) based on Tranfield et al.’s (2003) approach. The extensively preferred PRISMA technique was adopted for conducting a systematic literature review. VOSviewer program was used in this study for bibliometric analysis. The contribution of this study is that this is the first one to use a bibliometric analysis and SLR on the topic of blockchain technology, environment, and green finance from the standpoint of the SDGs, specifically SDG 7 and SDG 13.

abstract = {Hospital acquired infections stemming from contaminated reusable medical devices are of increasing concern. This issue is exaggerated with the introduction of complex medical devices like endoscopes and robotic instrumentation. Although medical device manufacturers validate their cleaning instructions for use, evidence in the literature demonstrates that effective device processing is not being performed consistently within sterile processing departments in clinical settings. The result is increased risks to patient safety. As a solution to this problem, focused one-on-one training increases compliance to the medical device manufacturer's processing instruction. However, often this is not a practical solution for the volume of healthcare staff responsible for device processing activities. This constitutes the first paper to address the blended use of educational and digital technologies to address these challenges and as a result inform safety and sustainability for the medical device sector. Cognitive learning theory is an evidence-based framework for learning. It supports the use of immersive educational experiences using emerging extended reality technologies (e.g., virtual or augmented reality) to increase learning comprehension. The delivery of educational content via these technologies provides an innovative option for repeatable leaning and training outcomes. The motivation is to decrease patient risk of contaminated reusable medical devices. The proposed approach while primary motivated by safety can also enhance sustainability and efficiency enabled by artificial intelligence and robotic instrumentation.}

abstract = {With the emergence of the Cyber–Physical Systems (CPSs) along with the fourth industrial revolution, the discussion of distributed architecture and coordination and extensive communication between all components of a system was raised. On the other hand, Modern industrial manufacturing relies heavily on flexible production. Autonomous mobile manipulators (MMs) have the potential to improve the flexibility of existing manufacturing environments. With the advantages associated with this technology, there is an upsurge in the demand for MMs. Thus, adding a new MM as a new CPS into a system following industry 4.0 requires a framework to help taking all the advantages from it. In this article, we proposed a framework to integrating MMs as CPSs into an existing production system. This integration requires comprehensive knowledge of the existing production process and control, which is a view to improve the performance of the existing production systems via new functionalities due to MMs. The next step of the framework is to make new MM operations compatible with the existing production control system. For this purpose, we define different parametric blocks to perform new operations and thus contribute to making the production line more autonomous. Considering all of these issues simultaneously is necessary for an efficient integration in smart production context. For a successful integration, we presented four principal dimensions of integration: Physical integration, communicational integration, functional and operational integration, and digital integration. Furthermore, the framework has been applied to a research production line called Platform 4.0 at Arts et Métiers. An MM from OMRON Company (called MoMa) has been integrated into the existing production system. Results from this real-world demonstration show that MoMa is capable of successfully increasing flexibility, autonomy, and efficiency of a production system using command signals from Manufacturing Execution System (MES).}

The integrated nature of modern economic systems requires advanced solutions based on combination of state-of-the-art digital techniques with revised classical managerial, economical and mathematical approaches. The research gap is emphasized with the less of literature sources devoted to practical aspects of such combined tools applications. On this issue the authors suggest the algorithmic framework with analytical model on information control enhancement to transport-related operations within complex transportation systems. The article proposes a model of total transportation time (TTT) estimation considering various restrictions, elasticity coefficient of customer satisfaction, sustainable development and social aspects. As a result of better information control, transportation system becomes more flexible for alternative solutions. It explains the high applied value of the conducted research aimed also on planning improvement through the precise control procedures in transportation systems. Holistic view on the problem of TTT definition through the prism of information integration brings the discussion forward on how many factors should be considered in planning and controlling of integrated transportation systems. The given numerical example for multimodal international conveyance highlights the role of the proposed algorithmic foundations towards information management and control in multi-object systems. Probabilistic estimation of process reliability corresponds to the need of planning agile transportation systems. The purpose of the study is to contribute to the research field of stochastic on-time arrival (SOTA) problem with consideration of many factors influencing on performance in integrated transportation systems. The algorithmic framework proposes a conceptual basis for management, planning and information control. Application of the proposed methodology helps obtaining higher probability of on time arrival and increase reliability of transportation systems.}

However, China's conventional development pattern seriously threatens sustainable natural resource exploitation. Sustainable development, therefore, involves achieving higher economic development than the global average while paying lower social and resource costs. This paper examines the impact of ICT service exports and energy imports on natural resource sustainability in China from 1971 to 2020, using employment and trade as moderator variables. We employed ML ARCH - normal distribution BFGS Marquardt steps in the empirical analysis. Our result suggests that energy imports are statistically significant at 10%. ICT service exports are statistically significant at 1% significance, while total unemployment and trade are statistically significant at 5% significance. ICT service exports and total unemployment in China are negatively related to natural resource sustainability, while net energy imports and trade are positively related. ICT service exports have been found to impact natural resource sustainability positively. The use of technology has enabled the efficient management of resources, reducing waste and increasing productivity. This, in turn, has contributed to preserving natural resources, ensuring that they are used sustainably. On the other hand, energy imports have been shown to discourage sustainable development. Dependence on imported energy sources can lead to a lack of control over resource management, reducing the ability to ensure sustainability in the long term. This can lead to increased environmental degradation and negatively impacting natural resource sustainability.}

We found that the perception of smart governance enhances investment due to strong governance and abundant business opportunities. Natural sustainability attracts investment directly because, when cities become smart, they tend to improve their sustainability and attract talent and capital inflows. This external participation has a direct impact on enterprise investment because it creates more business opportunities. An improved social credit system represents the comprehensive progress of the business environment and positively mediates smart governance and investment. This is the first study to combine the key elements of smart governance, the development stage of smart governance, and various dimensions of the business environment to analyze the influence of smart governance perceptions on commercial investments.}

According to mechanism tests, we find that digital M&A enhance firms’ TFP through dual conduits: the refinement of the human capital structure within firms, and the escalation of firms’ investment in research and development (R&D). Further heterogeneous analysis show that the stimulating effect of digital M&A on firms’ TFP is more pronounced in highly competitive industries, in regions characterized by superior market development, and within non-state-owned enterprises.}

The objective is understanding the current applications of the traditional technologies used in the petroleum industry and studying the opportunities for implementing innovative digital tools and systems that could enhance the operational efficiency and reduce the cost, risk, and environmental impacts. The paper consists of several tasks starting from reviewing the present technologies used mainly in the upstream activities: exploration, field development, drilling and completion, and operation and production. The techniques used for gathering and analyzing the big data packages received from unlimited digitalized resources is the second task covered in this paper while the computing technologies such as cloud and cognitive computing as well as the advanced analytical and numerical solutions developed by real-time algorithms is the third task. Detail information about the short- and long-term digitalization technologies in both hardware and software parts is represented in this paper such as robotics and automation, powerful sensors and measuring tools, unmanned vehicles and drones, 3D printers and wearable gadgets as well as artificial inelegance, machine learning, and digital-twin computing. Real examples of currently used digitalized applications in different upstream sections of the petroleum industry are demonstrated while the expected added values created by the digitalization for the industry and communities and the possible changes either positively or negatively in the operational costs, maintenance patterns, workforce safety, environmental impacts, job positions, and the required skills and experiences during digitalization era are explained. The outcomes are summarized in the following points. The digitalization should be the priority for most upstream companies in order to enhance and optimize the production system. The big volume of data may require innovative computing tools that could develop powerful analytical models used for calibrating the production environment and maximizing the production capacity of oil and gas fields. Data transfer and data sharing are two key factors in the digital transformation where the integrated data platforms could enhance the collaboration among the participants of the oil and gas ecosystems and accelerate innovative solutions. The digital era may lead to a sharp decline in the workforce and significant changes in the job position description as the human intervention with the production system might be minimized. The expected added value of the digital transformation during the next decades will be very big wherein the upstream petroleum industry may have the biggest share that could be more than 60% of the total investments while the midstream industry may have only 10%. There will be also a lot of challenges represented by the fact that the petroleum industry has not yet made the necessary shift in mindset to embrace the digitalization potential. Moreover, the digitalization era may require new revolutionized regulations especially in terms of sharing the data and changing the structures of the organizations as well as the workforces.}

Our study theorizes how FinTech organizational capabilities (digital technologies, digital infrastructures, and talented employees) and FinTech ecosystem conditions (competitors, regulations, digital gender gaps, and institutional gaps) impact inclusion, transparency, and market expansion inspired by transformative entrepreneurship. We tested it through a multilevel analysis using data from 333 worldwide large FinTech platforms combined with secondary data at the country level. Results provide insights into how digital infrastructure, a skilled workforce, and closing the gaps for disadvantaged groups are crucial determinant factors for increasing FinTech impacts in emerging economies.

The eleven papers published in this special issue aim at contributing to the emerging research stream about the sustainable development of I4.0-CE-driven supply chains. In particular, four main macro-topics emerged: (i) I4.0-driven Circular Supply Chains (CSCs); (ii) Life Cycle Information in CE ecosystems; (iii) Waste management process optimisation; (iv) Drivers, challenges, opportunities, and barriers for I4.0-CE-driven supply chains. In the studies included in this special issue collection, novel conceptual frameworks and methodologies are proposed, and some practical cases are also conducted, promoting relevant advances in the twofold field of I4.0-CE, triggering the green and digital twin transition towards a supply chain and social dimension. Nevertheless, the analysis of the papers constituting the special issue reveals promising research opportunities necessary to investigate and explore this emerging domain in its specific facets. More quantitative studies are needed to understand better the dynamics in CSC, CE ecosystems and Industrial Symbiosis networks.

However, achieving optimal detection performance through DNN training has posed challenges due to computational intensity and vulnerability to adversarial samples. To address these issues, this paper introduces an optimization method that combines regularization and simulated micro-batching. This approach enables the training of DNNs in a robust, efficient, and resource-friendly manner for IoT security monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DNN model, including its performance in Federated Learning (FL) settings, exhibits improved attack detection and resistance to adversarial perturbations compared to benchmark baseline models and conventional Machine Learning (ML) methods typically employed in IoT security monitoring. Notably, the proposed method achieves significant reductions of 79.54% and 21.91% in memory and time usage, respectively, when compared to the benchmark baseline in simulated virtual worker environments. Moreover, in realistic testbed scenarios, the proposed method reduces memory footprint by 6.05% and execution time by 15.84%, while maintaining accuracy levels that are superior or comparable to state-of-the-art methods. These findings validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed optimization method for enhancing the efficiency and robustness of DNN-based IoT security monitoring.}

DTs promise increased productivity and sustainable performance by integrating data, models, and decision-support systems. However, before realizing the potential benefits of DTs for maintenance management, several challenges need to be addressed, including a lack of conceptual basis, functional description, and established requirements. Hence, the paper presents, in a practical manner, how to cover this gap in digital configurations for maintenance management, designed to benefit of DTs. The scope of the paper includes the design and implementation of an innovative condition-based maintenance application (CBM App) based on a DT of train axle bearings, and uses a generic framework for digital maintenance management for the functional description of the DT within the CBM App. The paper provides details of the models and algorithms used to build the DT and ensures that recommended features are fulfilled. To test the DT's effectiveness and robustness, the design and framework are implemented in real CBM applications of TALGO, a high-speed train manufacturer. These tools are deemed helpful for easing DT implementation within the CBM App and can be replicated in other operational contexts.}

abstract = {This research aims to design an implementation framework for Lean 4.0. First, we identify the synergy elements, barriers, critical success factors, and benefits of integrating Lean manufacturing (LM) practices and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies. Second, we develop a Lean 4.0 framework proposal based on these results. Third, we refine and validate this framework based on lean practitioners’ participation from companies pursuing I4.0 initiatives. In last, we apply the Lean 4.0 framework in a sugar company. We perform a multi-method study employing a scoping review, a systematic literature review, one-to-one interviews, vignette cases with an expert panel, validation of the framework by practitioners, and implementation in an industrial company. We reveal 15 synergy elements based on ten I4.0 technologies and nine LM practices. Further, eight barriers, eight critical success factors, and four clusters based on 22 benefits are identified. Our findings support the proposition of a Lean 4.0 implementation framework and contribute to operations management research theory and practice. Our research addresses the gap regarding an in-depth theoretical study linking LM and I4.0 conjointly with an empirically validated artefact, aiming to integrate their best benefits synergistically. Besides that, our article uses a multi-method approach to building a system-oriented Lean 4.0 implementation framework based on General Systems Theory, containing clear guidelines for framework design and a plan-do-check-act cycle orientation.}

abstract = {Background
The industrial Internet represents a fundamental infrastructure for future digitalization, networking, intelligent change, and innovation in the manufacturing industry. In this study, an index system was constructed to evaluate the maturity level of the industrial Internet in the building materials industry.
Method
Based on factor analysis and the entropy weight method, we constructed a method of evaluating the maturity level of industrial Internet for building materials companies. Specifically, an industrial Internet maturity evaluation index system for building materials companies was established through factor analysis, and the weights of various evaluation indexes were assigned using the entropy method. In our study, 59 representative building materials companies were selected as research samples, and empirical research was conducted. Thereafter, one company was selected to verify the evaluation model. Finally, the comprehensive scores and rankings of the 59 building materials companies and their individual scores were calculated.
Results
This study identified seven key indicators for assessing industrial Internet maturity in the building materials industry: data analysis and usage, information network facilities, intelligence level of the system, smart device networking, comprehensive integration, safety management digitization rate, and R & D digitization rate. The study indicated that the majority of large-scale building materials companies were at a 2-star level of industrial Internet maturity, indicating an overall primary stage. The study revealed that information network infrastructure had a relatively high level, but comprehensive integration and data analysis capacity were comparatively weak. Moreover, the R&D digitalization rate and the safety management digitalization rate showed consistent development levels.
Research implication
This study introduces the first maturity model for the industrial internet in the building materials industry, guiding government decision-making and providing self-assessment direction for companies. It aims to effectively address the industry's challenges of high energy consumption, emissions, labor shortages, and low efficiency.}

In contrast, the food supply chain has numerous challenges, like food traceability, transportation, and packaging. Industry 4.0 can significantly overcome these challenges in sustainable food supply chain using technologies like IoT, Block chain, cyber security, etc. In India, most food industries are failed to implement Industry 4.0 due to various barriers. This study aims to discover these critical barriers to enable sustainable food supply chain to adopt Industry 4.0 and provide adequate solutions. Using the Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (PF-AHP) and Pythagorean fuzzy-evaluation based on distance from average solution (PF-EDAS) methodologies, we have provided a hybrid framework for the study to prioritize the solutions to overcome the barriers of Industry 4.0 enabled sustainable food supply chain. The relative weights of each barrier are determined using the PF-AHP technique, and the solution to these barriers is prioritized using the PF-EDAS method. The case study of Indian food industry is considered to demonstrate the applicability of proposed framework. The finding of this research reveals that barriers based on ‘organizational’, ‘strategic’, and ‘social’ aspects has encumbers the adoption of Industry 4.0 enabled food supply chain and its negative influence is about more than 50 % on efficient implementation of Industry 4.0 enabled food supply chain. The top management's poor perception of digitization and lack of willingness to adopt Industry 4.0 enabled sustainable food supply chain are the most critical barriers, whereas top management commitment and support is the most vital solution followed by the government to provide the financial subsidies and taxation relief. This study will aid the company and industrial practitioners in developing strategies for efficiently implementing Industry 4.0 in food supply chain for attaining the sustainability. This study outcomes acts as stepping stone and helps to excel the various missions of government of India in regards to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and Clean Digital India.}

To this end, the movable factory concept has been put forward, which is defined as mobile production units that can be installed near the customer’s location. Unfortunately, industrial paradigms such as Industry 4.0 make little if any notice of movable factories but instead focus on the digitalization of their fixed counterparts. In the form of a systematic literature review, this paper breaks down the concept of the movable factory, relates it to the state-of-the-art, and summarizes its main use cases, requirements, research gaps, and opportunities. The review covers over 100 relevant articles published in the past two decades. Compared to existing surveys, we have not only focused on the motivations for movable factories, but also identified research gaps and discuss the impact of modern technologies such as Internet-of-Things, digital twins, and modeling and simulation in fulfilling these gaps. The result is a survey of the state-of-the-art and a list of domains for potential future research on different aspects of movable factories.}

abstract = {Objective
Emerging spinal cord stimulation (SCS) remote monitoring and programming technologies provide a unique opportunity to address challenges of in-person visits and improve patient care, although clinical guidance on implementation is needed. The goal of this document is to establish best clinical practices for integration of remote device management into the care of patients with SCS, including remote monitoring and remote programming.
Materials and Methods
A panel of experts in SCS met in July 2022, and additional experts contributed to the development of recommendations after the meeting via survey responses and correspondence.
Results
Major goals of remote SCS device management were identified, including prompt identification and resolution of SCS-related issues. The panel identified metrics for remote monitoring and classified them into three categories: device-related (eg, stimulation usage); measurable physiologic or disease-related (eg, patient physical activity or pedometry); and patient-reported (eg, sleep quality and pain intensity). Recommendations were made for frequency of reviewing remote monitoring metrics, although providers should tailor follow-up to individual patient needs. Such periodic reviews of remote monitoring metrics would occur separately from automatic monitoring system notifications (if key metrics fall outside an acceptable range). The guidelines were developed in consideration of reimbursement processes, privacy concerns, and the responsibilities of the care team, industry professionals, manufacturers, patients, and caregivers. Both existing and needed clinical evidence were covered, including outcomes of interest for future studies.
Conclusions
Given the expansion of SCS device capabilities, this document provides critical guidance on best practices for using remote device management, although medical necessity should drive all remote monitoring decisions, with individualized patient care. The authors also describe the potential of these emerging technologies to improve outcomes for patients with SCS, although more clinical evidence is needed.}

Technology start-up enterprises are currently increasingly gaining attention in Thailand. However, for a technology start-up to be successful is not an easy path. Critical success factors (CSFs) from experts are necessary at the start. In this research two sectors: general technology (GeneralTech) and deep technology (DeepTech) are investigated. Entrepreneurs who wish to shift their businesses from GeneralTech to DeepTech can also understand what they have to focus on in running a relevant and successful business. Fuzzy Logarithmic Full Consistency Method (FUCOM-LF) has been applied to rank the CSFs for technology start-ups. This newly developed method has been compared with the existing methods; Logarithmic Fuzzy Preference Programming method (LFPP) and Fuzzy Logarithmic Full Consistency Method (FUCOM-F). The results have shown that the FUCOM-LF has advantages over existing methods because it uses a smaller number of pairwise comparisons with full consistency and it can get reliable results based on evaluated data. It is also not necessary to defuzzify the final value like FUCOM-F. The findings reveal that the three main CSFs for GeneralTech start-ups in Thailand are market and customer, key persons, and value propositions, while CSFs for DeepTech start-ups are market and customer, value propositions, and key persons, respectively. To shift from GeneralTech start-ups to DeepTech start-ups entrepreneurs should enhance their value propositions.}

Enhanced tax enforcement is particularly prominent if a firm is with significant financing constraints, is a non-state-owned enterprise, or is bigger. Furthermore, we find that the implementation of the CTAIS-3 pilot has increased fairness because it is more effective in lowering the performance of large-scale enterprises, primarily because it reduces the government subsidies and tax benefits that these companies receive.}

Based on this analysis, fourteen main common themes have been identified among national AI policies, which predominantly relate to educational, technological, government, ethical/legal, and social good concerns. Following this, we conducted a co-occurrence analysis of topics across countries to determine the extent of topic prioritization in each country. In this investigation, several marginalized AI policy topics were also identified. In general, the challenges and concerns of the majority of policies pertain to education, technology, and the government. Governments refer to real-world projects and investments in AI technologies without developing shared digital governance platforms that promote responsible and sustainable AI among technology titans and mitigate the negative effects of surveillance capitalism. Although governments acknowledge the ethical and legal aspects of AI development and frequently cite the GDPR, they limit their discussion to the data level, particularly data sharing, and marginalize ethical algorithms and other phases of data and AI management and design. In addition, government policies marginalize AI startups and the API economy, even though they play a crucial role in fostering the AI ecosystem. The paper contributes to the existing literature on AI policy and will serve as a guide for AI policymakers to help them better understand the topical similarities across countries and the neglected or marginalized challenges that require further attention.}

A good effect of this is the significant productivity enhancement in all its aspects such as reduction of raw material consumption and of production times. But production systems are made of an interaction between human and machines, as the recent literature on Industry 5.0 recalled, trying to reset the role of human actor in the collaboration process in manufacturing. The basic idea is that embracing the Industry 5.0 paradigm, the intelligent cooperation of human operator with properly designed machines may allow an higher efficiency and precision in manufacturing processes based on I4.0. This paper, starting from a widespread review of all the available assessment models about sustainability and smartness (now turning into “digitainability”), encompassing also maturity models and standards formally proposes a metamodel to support assessment model design and implementation. The metamodel allows to set all the necessary dimensions required for a comprehensive view of any manufacturing reality aimed to move toward a Industry 5.0 paradigm.}

It greatly facilitates the digitalization of user data, environment conditions, and interaction process, which makes digital transformation (DT) feasible in smart home context to help create innovative life services and additional user values. Cross-device interaction has thusly become an important measure in realizing DT in smart home areas, and related studies are growing rapidly. Unlike previous reviews, which mainly focus on the historical development, the applications and evaluation strategies of cross-device interaction, a user-centric perspective was proposed in this work to emphasize the user experience and user values. For the purpose, a systematic literature review approach was developed, and 130 articles in recent 15 years were obtained and reviewed. Through text mining and bibliometric analysis, the topics attracting higher research attention were identified. Following the identified research spots, the related works were analyzed from the aspects of (i) main services supported by cross-device interaction, (ii) common interaction configurations for different service purposes, and (iii) user-perceived values brought by cross-device interaction. Moreover, the challenges which hinder the deepened digitalization of smart home systems were discussed, including data quality, user experience and system safety issues. Accordingly, future development opportunities in the further integration of emerging digital technologies, attempts in natural interaction, and extension of smart home scenarios were suggested. This review is expected to help researchers better understand the role of cross-device interaction in digitalizing a complex smart home system, provide references on effective configuration of interaction systems for different purposes, and shed light on future development directions in this area.}

Subsequently, the local energy community independently produces alternative pellet biofuel, from the initial cultivation of young woody plants to the final production of ecological wood-based fuel with a calorific value of 16 MJ/ kg. The proposed innovative method of heat production leads to environmental benefits, energy savings, reduced payments for energy supply, and overall modernization of the technologies used.}

abstract = {We investigate the dynamic and qualitative nature of technological change in 96 countries between 1980 and 2021 from a structuralist technology upgrading perspective. First, drawing from patent data, we map the dynamics of technological knowledge by exploring the growth rates and significance of technology clusters. Second, we explore whether there is a relationship between specific technology clusters and economic growth. Third, we examine whether countries at different levels of development share similar or heterogeneous technology upgrading profiles and how patterns of technology upgrading have changed over time. We use a long-term, technology-level, cross-country patent dataset, and to address the issues identified we apply two complementary analytical methods: Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) panel data analysis and Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fs/QCA). We find a significant association between growth dynamics and country-level specific technology clusters that is driven by the ongoing ICT-based technological revolution and enabling nanotechnology, biotechnology and automation tools. Heterogenous trajectories in technological profiles allowed us to distinguish between more productive and less productive technology upgrading profiles at different income levels. Our results suggest that innovation policy should go beyond mission oriented policies focused solely on newly emerging technologies. Instead, it should develop policy mixes conceived as portfolios of missions focused on technology clusters with disparate objectives, requirements and institutional setups.}

The results achieved were also put under analysis, considering the European Framework for Educators' Digital Competence (DigCompEdu), and a shy presence of technologies was identified in the analysed curricula. Regarding DigCompEdu, which functions as a common framework to be followed in the European Union, the results show that this is configured as another factor to be remedied in the context of integrating ICT in ITE in Portugal. Among the contributions that this study promotes is the finding of the reduced presence of ICT identified in the context under study, a reality familiar to several countries, which implies in curricular terms, initial teacher training is still ineffective in preparing teachers to meet the needs of today's digital society.}

The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as one of the expedient technologies in the information technology domain, which solves the issues of traditional supply chain management (SCM) by providing resiliency, flexibility, and traceability. Despite the perceived advantages of IoT, it remains unknown what drivers are essential to adopt IoT in SCM. To achieve this aim, an integrated approach combining rough set theory and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), that is rough strength relation analysis (RSRA) method, has been used to identify and investigate drivers of IoT adoption in SCM where drivers were analyzed according to their comparative importance based on expert opinions from industrial and academic backgrounds. A total of 14 drivers have been identified from the extensive literature review on previous IoT and SCM associated works, which were further analyzed to determine the most important drivers. The results show that “Efficient logistics systems”, “Business knowledge acumen”, and “Information safety assurance” are among the three most predominant driving factors. The findings may help practitioners implement IoT in supply chains to deal with disruptions, risks and vulnerabilities in the post-pandemic era.}

Maintaining an adequate level of situation awareness (SA) is critical for safety. Recent years have seen increasing research interests in SA and digital technology (DT) in the construction safety field. However, there lacks a systematic review that elucidates the impacts of DT on workers’ cognitive processes involved in hazard identification. To fill the research gap, the paper aims to conceptualize the role of SA and DT in construction safety management and provide a theoretical basis for the future development of technology-enabled situation-aware construction safety management systems. This study employed a five-step systematic review approach with a scientometric analysis to provide an unbiased and comprehensive overview of research concerning SA in construction safety. The results suggested that current research on the cognitive processes related to hazard identification has been fragmented and has caused theoretical confusion. There is a need to develop a cognitive framework for hazard identification. Four specific research directions were recommended: (1) develop and validate a real-time SA measurement, (2) identify SA information requirements, (3) develop a cognitive model of hazard identification, and (4) develop a technology-enhanced SA system. By synthesizing the current literature, this review paper identified and analyzed the theoretical roles of SA and DT in worker hazard identification, shedding light on the potential for developing a technology-enabled situation-aware construction safety management system. It also offered a valuable perspective to review and re-design safety management practices.}

Results showed that children tended to conceptualize DC superficially as personal responsibility and generally ignored the role of active online engagement. The game's mechanism had weak influence on how children conceptualized this idea, mainly reflected in the change of importance they perceived during the game. These changes were related to their perceptions of emotion, game design, and value commitments. Children jointly showed their interest in the game and exhibited diverse behaviors and learning reflections during the game.

Although a few studies have investigated the role of individual technologies (e.g., blockchain) in ESG, applying a broader set of emerging technologies in improving ESG disclosure and addressing its limitations is yet to be explored. Industry 5.0 offers a powerful framework for understanding the role of technologies in enhancing ESG disclosure. This conceptual paper explains ESG from the lens of management theories and views, including stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory, transaction cost economics theory, institutional theory, signaling theory, network economics theory, and the decoupling view. It then explores the application of I5.0 in enhancing ESG disclosure. The underlying values of I5.0 align with those of ESG, and I5.0 can support ESG functionalities. I5.0 is particularly useful in enhancing ESG disclosure authenticity, extending ESG disclosure from retrospective to prospective and real-time reporting, customizing ESG reports, extending the scope of reporting to multi-tier supply chains, reducing ESG cost, and enhancing the overall efficacy of ESG disclosure. The paper also sheds light on governance aspects, challenges, and risks of employing I5.0 to ESG.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this article is to analyze the digital innovations which are being introduced in the HRM field in organizations in the modern business services sector in Finland and Poland. It is also intended to identify the most important factors/trends that influence digital innovations and to identify the challenges they generate for HRM departments. The practical objective is to develop recommendations for organizations executives, policy makers and researchers.
Design/methodology/approach
The research was mainly based on a quantitative research approach and a questionnaire survey. Additionally, the authors conducted a semi-structured interview was with the representatives of the HRM departments in the surveyed organizations. The qualitative research of the obtained results allowed to deepen the obtained quantitative data. The purpose of the data triangulation used was to increase the reliability of the data.
Findings
Nearly 90% of HRM employees declared that the companies they work for have implemented digital innovations. Among the introduced digital innovations, chatbots, dashboards, application software systems, a virtual HRM assistant and digital tools were indicated. The COVID-19 pandemic and the progress of robotization and automation have accelerated the implementation of digital technologies in HR departments in both Poland and Finland. There are however differences between the two countries – it is evident that in Finland digital innovations were already introduced by modern businesses organizations before the pandemic period, while in Poland the innovations were mostly implemented during and after the pandemic period. It is worth emphasizing the differences regarding the two countries in terms of the level of technology advancement.
Research limitations/implications
Similar to most studies conducted, this study has its limitations and the authors are aware of them. First, future research using the tool which was used in this study should focus on confirming its reliability. Secondly, its scope and scale were limited as it was not possible to obtain an industry-wide sample. It should be noted that the obtained results cannot be generalized to a broader context, although they provide valuable conclusions and recommendations and may be an inspiration for further research. For the future research, it is recommended that the researchers should pay more attention to the challenges and difficulties that accompany digital innovations in HRM departments. One of the aspects is the need to pay attention to the cultural and psychological aspects of the presence of technology in organizational areas, which have only been signaled in this article. A more in-depth study could address the issue of negative attitudes toward the introduction and use of digital technologies. The future research could focus on creating the necessary conditions at each stage of introducing digital innovations and using the potential of these tools – starting with needs analyses, awareness of goals, benefits, dealing with concerns and risks, communication and evaluation and assessment of the technology in question. For future research, it is recommended that researchers pay more attention to the challenges and difficulties that accompany digital innovations in HRM departments.

Practical implications
The study provides suggestions for practice, providing companies in Finland and Poland with the insight into the impact of the trends on the development of digital innovations in HRM departments and the challenges they generate. The contributions of this study are also the recommendations and guidelines for organizations to effectively implement digital technologies. This will allow not only to better adapt to the present situation, but also to more accurately predict future trends.
Social implications
The research results can be useful for the development of HRM practices, as traditional practices are increasingly being replaced by new digital modes of leading and managing capital resources in organizations. This development is followed by the need for new competencies in HRM (Mazurchenko, Maršíková, 2019), a new understanding of leadership, thus digital tools may prove particularly supportive in this context (Salojärvi, 2018). Digital innovation research conducted in the modern business services industry can be particularly valuable in the context of the flow of technological innovations, including know-how, implementation of modern organizational solutions; which transfers to other industries (MORR, 2017). Digital innovations can contribute to reducing the complexity of HRM functions, which will accelerate management and personnel decisions. It will improve the quality of analytical data, as well as increase access to employees and opportunities in planning their personal development. As a result, the introduction of digital innovations will contribute to reducing costs and increasing the efficiency of HRM processes.
Originality/value
This study provides a new and timely perspective by examining applied digital innovations and related challenges affecting the implementation of digital innovations by HRM departments in the modern business services sector. This survey provides comprehensive information on how and what can enhance the capacity for digital innovation in Finnish and Polish organizations. This article theoretically analyzes the importance of technological development for HRM departments and reviews the previous research on digital technologies in HRM departments and the factors and challenges of introducing digital innovations. It also characterizes the modern business services sector, which is very active in introducing digital innovations.}

We will describe how technology is preparing and supporting a shift of spiritual experience from physical to augmented spaces, by analyzing how technology interacts with both spiritual practices (rituals and places) and mediators (officiants and artifacts). We will also describe how the new forms of inequalities may emerge from this shift and might further impact current and future spiritual practices.}

abstract = {The study is inspired by the change in the risk landscape caused by the development of digitalization and automation in the high-risk industry. The increasing convergence of process-safety, physical security, and cybersecurity risks can lead to major accidents. Integrated management of safety and security (IMSS) is a necessary means of preventing and preparing for accidents. The objective of this paper is to get new insights into the current state of IMSS and related challenges in the nuclear industry. The data includes the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and World Institute for Nuclear Security (WINS) reports, articles on digitalization, IMSS, and interviews with safety and security experts from two power companies and the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority in Finland. The paper compares the results with those in Seveso installations. The methods are thematic and qualitative content analysis. Theoretical framework consists of organizational culture and management perspectives. The paper provides new meanings to the ways in which IMSS is currently implemented. The paper shows the IAEA structural support to IMSS, differences in IMSS implementation in the nuclear industry, and organizational cultural aspects that constrain the IMSS. The latter include the subordination of security to safety, the assumption that organizational culture automatically integrates safety and security, the lack of co-identification and co-assessment of safety and security risks, which prevents a better understanding of systemic risks. The conclusion is that the current state of IMSS is not adequate to address converging, systemic risks, and coordination of safety and security aspects requires more attention.}

abstract = {With the rapid development and widespread use of digital technologies in the workplace in China, employers’ right to monitor and direct employees has often been abused, raising a number of disputes over the infringement of employees’ right to privacy in terms of their personal information. China must urgently develop an appropriate approach to balancing these two conflicting interests. However, there is currently no coherent and uniform regime governing the protection of employees’ personal information in China. The primary legal source on which employers can rely is the latest version of the Chinese Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), which offers three lawful bases for employers’ processing of their employees’ personal information. These bases are employee consent; “necessity for the conclusion or performance of an employment contract”; and “necessity for conducting human resource management.” Concerns have been expressed regarding the reasonableness and effectiveness of the three lawful bases under the PIPL. First, it is both legally and practically problematic for the PIPL to rely so heavily on employee consent. Second, it is unclear whether the other two lawful bases relieve employers of the duty of notification and, if so, how to safeguard employees’ right to know. Third, the ambiguous standard of “necessity” requires clarification. This article argues that China should adopt many elements from EU law, while US law should be only followed in relation to the standard of “necessity”. In relation to employee consent, the EU approach is preferable to the US approach. As the EU approach does not generally regard employees’ consent as a lawful basis for the processing of their information and uses the other two lawful bases as alternatives to employee consent, this approach better reflects the customary practices of employee subordination and employer control in China. In contrast, US law deems employee consent to be an absolute general defense to the tort of privacy violation and adopts an employer favoritism approach to balancing these two conflicting interests, which is not appropriate in the Chinese context. In relation to the scope of necessity, three tests taken from the EU and US approaches should be considered by the Chinese courts. In addition, when processing personal information based on the other two lawful bases, employers should safeguard employees’ right to know through collective contracts concluded with labor unions or employee representatives under the Chinese Labor Contract Law, which would effectively address employers’ arbitrariness. Ultimately, these changes would produce a better balance between employees’ right to privacy in terms of their personal information and employers’ need to subordinate and control employees.}

Inductive methods, co-word assessments, content analysis are deployed to develop qualitative commentaries indicating geo-specific performances of the banks. The research findings indicate goal-specific attribution and discovery of motives and initiatives. This validates how motives in embracing the SDGs vary and relate to achievement of – (A) core business objectives; (B) support and financing of other industries, organizations, and governments in sustainable initiatives; and (C) corporate citizenship, altruistic and ethical considerations. Methodological approaches to calibrate findings across seventeen SDGs help identify benchmark practices, understand complementary actions, and required focus for banks and other industries. This is relevant to geo-specific sustainability challenges, trade-offs, and requirements. The findings can guide public policies and regulations, empower banks and other institutions to accelerate awareness and evaluate effectiveness towards sustainable developments.}

With the evolution of Industry 4.0, the integration of digital informatics and decisions is crucial for smart manufacturing, Logistics 4.0, and supply chain digitization. However, much of digital content lacks interconnection. As such, the Digital Twin (DT) was proposed to promote the integration of physical machines and devices with the digital space. Augmented reality (AR) usually works in conjunction with the DT network to collect and provide real-time data. In fact, most of the AR devices are not fully connected in DT as the decision support from AI is disconnected. On the other hand, human-machines and object interactions are still complicated in AR, thus limiting applications. In order to achieve digital twinning for object recognition and human-machine interaction, we proposed a DT architecture for integrating the latest Mixed Reality (MR) device for real-time data streaming. Object recognition is empowered by the AI algorithm in the backend cloud computing and database. The entire system integrates the informatics between physical machines and devices and the digital content using an AI algorithm. Our proposed method achieved real-time informatics integration of MR and AI, while the warehouse is used as a case scenario with simulations. Industrial informatics integration can be applied for smart manufacturing, smart warehouse, and many Industry 4.0 applications.}

This article seeks to provide a broader organizational understanding of cyber-resilience and the tensions associated with its implementation. We apply Weick's (1995) sensemaking framework to examine four foundational tensions of cyber-resilience: a definitional tension, an environmental tension, an internal tension, and a regulatory tension. We then document how these tensions are embedded in cyber-resilience practices at the preparatory, response and adaptive stages. We rely on qualitative data from a sample of 58 cybersecurity professionals to uncover these tensions and how they reverberate across cyber-resilience practices.}

Global eye health is defined as the degree to which vision, ocular health, and function are maximised worldwide, thereby optimising overall wellbeing and quality of life. Improving eye health is a global priority as a key to unlocking human potential by reducing the morbidity burden of disease, increasing productivity, and supporting access to education. Although extraordinary progress fuelled by global eye health initiatives has been made over the last decade, there remain substantial challenges impeding further progress. The accelerated development of digital health and artificial intelligence (AI) applications provides an opportunity to transform eye health, from facilitating and increasing access to eye care to supporting clinical decision making with an objective, data-driven approach. Here, we explore the opportunities and challenges presented by digital health and AI in global eye health and describe how these technologies could be leveraged to improve global eye health. AI, telehealth, and emerging technologies have great potential, but require specific work to overcome barriers to implementation. We suggest that a global digital eye health task force could facilitate coordination of funding, infrastructural development, and democratisation of AI and digital health to drive progress forwards in this domain.}

This study examines this issue based on data from the 2017–2021 periods of the Canadian Survey of Cybersecurity and Cybercrime administered to Canadian organizations. We assessed the effects of governance determinants along with cyber incidents and their impacts using partial least squares equation modelling to identify the relationships between these factors and cybersecurity incidents reported to police services. To conceptualize these relationships, we developed a framework based on resource-dependence theory, protection motivation theory, and previous empirical evidence. The overall governance determinants as well as the impacts of the incidents explained 51% of the intention to report cybersecurity incidents to police, and the intensity of the impacts explained 30% of these intentions to signal incidents to law enforcement. The results also revealed that the intensity of cyber incident impacts dictates the attitudes of organizations towards reporting digital attacks. This study makes a significant theoretical contribution to the information security literature and has practical implications for standard setters and government agencies that aim to combat cybersecurity incidents.}

A difference-in-differences method was used to analyze the impact and transmission mechanism of the policy on the corporate sustainability. The results show that BDPZ policy can enhance the corporate sustainability and the reliability of the findings is demonstrated by a series of robustness tests. From the mechanism test, the BDPZ construction can strengthen the infrastructure effect, stimulate the talent effect and enhance the transaction effect to advance corporate digitalization and enhance their sustainability. From the heterogeneity analysis, the corporate sustainability enhancement effect of BDPZ construction is more significant for high-tech enterprises, but not for resource-intensive industries and enterprises in cross-regional type pilot zones. This study intends to supply micro-level empirical support for the policy dividends of digital policy, as well as policy references and empirical proof for the popularization of BDPZ model to empower digital transformation of enterprises.}

Although the ethical considerations may seem distant from mere regulatory compliance, the opposite is true. The article focuses on the positive side of the “ethification” of digital laws through the lens of legal requirements for impact assessments pursuant to General Data Protection Regulation and conformity assessments in the proposal for the Artificial Intelligence Act. Authors argue that ethical considerations are often absent in the context of using new technologies including artificial intelligence, yet they may provide additional value for organizations and society as a whole. Additionally, carrying out ethics-based assessments is already in line with existing regulatory requirements in the fields of data protection law and proposed EU AI regulation. These arguments are reflected in the context of facial recognition technology, where both data protection impact assessment under the EU General Data Protection Regulation and conformity assessment under the proposal of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act will be mandatory. Facial recognition technology is analyzed through the ethics-based assessment involving stakeholder analysis, data flows map, and identification of risks and respective countermeasures to show additional insights that ethics provides beyond regulatory requirements.}

abstract = {Globalization, digital acceleration, and market shocks have all revealed the importance of new product development in enabling companies to remain competitive. Focusing on digitally mature companies, we look into the different routes that organizations can take to accomplish this goal, involving a mix of inbound/outbound open innovation, digital transformation, and absorptive capabilities in the path towards higher levels of new product development performance. By employing structural equation modeling and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, four different organizational pathways emerge. A detailed analysis of these pathways provides further insights for scholars and practitioners, enhancing our understanding of the active role of open innovation, digital transformation, and absorptive capacity in new product development performance.}

abstract = {The profound ramifications stemming from a multitude of global events and the ongoing progression of the fourth and fifth industrial revolutions necessitate a broadening of skillsets beyond the mere acquisition of technical and digital proficiencies. The practical, intelligent, responsible, and sustainable utilisation of technologies relies exclusively on human agency. Such employment necessitates a type of cognitive processing that machines find arduous, emphasising the importance of aligning human reasoning with machine intelligence. The significance of digital skills is widely acknowledged within the framework of cultivating suitable sets of employee abilities. Nonetheless, it is imperative to underscore the importance of human skills as they remain irreplaceable by robots. Furthermore, the labour market acknowledges and rewards these skills owing to their capacity to confer flexibility and adaptability, thereby embodying the competing attributes of the future workforce. In light of the prevailing circumstances outlined in Industry 5.0—characterised by an amplified utilisation of technologies and diminished interpersonal interactions resulting from the pervasive impact of the Covid-19 pandemic—this study seeks to provide a theoretical description of the significance of soft skills and their categorisation, while investigating the practical demand for such skills. The dataset used in this study encompasses information pertaining to skill prerequisites extracted from job posts published on a job portal over five years, encompassing 19 000 distinct organisations. The findings of our study revealed that within technologically driven domains, there is a discernible demand for soft skills, such as critical and analytical thinking, problem-solving, communication skills, and creativity with flexibility. Furthermore, our results indicate that individuals must possess balanced proficiency in both soft and digital skills to thrive in a future characterised by technological advancements.}

abstract = {As the world's aging population increases, leveraging technology to support aging is proving advantageous. Notably, technology adoption studies among older adults have received increasing scholarly attention, but findings from these studies do not reflect the context of low-income older adults. Studies focusing on low-income older adults were relatively few and it remains unclear which factors influence this group's technology use. This systematic review aims to synthesize findings on factors influencing technology use among low-income older adults to provide directions and opportunities for future research in information systems. Observing the literature through the lens of Social Cognitive Theory, we identified avenues for future research and further integrated the framework with Maslow's hierarchy of needs to elucidate the phenomenon. Findings from this systematic review suggest that both personal and environmental factors, such as cognitions, affects, sociodemographic characteristics, technological and social environment are significant predictors of technology use among low-income older adults. Specifically, factors related to accessibility and affordability, such as income, perceived cost, and accessibility to technology are salient in a resource-limited setting. More importantly, the technology usage behavior elucidate the embeddedness of fundamental human needs which plays a central role underlying technology use among this segment. However, more research is needed to understand the interaction between person, environment and behavior determinant shaping technology use among low-income older adults from diverse economic and cultural setting. This study also sheds light on disciplinary gaps and the lack of investigations anchored on theoretical foundations, and suggests avenues for future research and implications for practice.}
