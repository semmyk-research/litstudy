abstract = {The world is in the midst of a digital transformation. An intensified prevalence and use of digital technologies is fundamentally changing organizations and economies. However, the notion of 'digital transformation' is both theoretically and empirically underspecified. This paper rethinks the digital transformation narrative theoretically by embedding the concept in concurrent debates about technological revolutions and neo-Schumpeterian innovation theory. Empirically, the paper specifies the digital transformation by analysing the technological composition of key start-up and scale-up companies in the knowledge-intensive services sector. Undertaking a technology space analysis of 40,754 start-up and scale-up companies derived from the near real-time Dealroom.co database, we analyse which technologies and application domains are currently converging, distilling of key elements of the digital transformation. The paper concludes that the transmission of digital technologies is often indirect through ‘key enabling technology clusters’ that connect the technological vanguard to application domains.}

abstract = {As GovTech solutions are steadily entering the public sector, they have yet to find their way into the mainstream literature. GovTech refers to socio-technical solutions – that are developed and operated by private organisations – intertwined with public sector components for facilitating processes in the public sector. GovTech solutions promise a superior customer journey for citizens and businesses compared to current government portals and front desks. GovTech solutions can be a blessing in disguise for governments struggling in their digital transformation journey, carrying the burden of public service innovation and replacing legacy systems with modern GovTech solutions. Yet, there are also concerns that GovTech solutions are a Trojan horse, exploiting the lack of technical knowledge at public agencies and shifting decision-making power from public agencies to market parties, thereby undermining digital sovereignty and public values. This paper develops a research agenda for GovTech based on a conceptual framework. This framework reveals four interrelated design areas for GovTech: institutional, governance, technical and human-centred design. Governments can employ the conceptual framework to further align and develop their strategies by focussing on GovTech governance, referring to the ability to manage the various interdependencies between the four design areas.}

Despite the potential benefits of I4.0 technologies in operations management reported in the extant literature, there has been a paucity of empirical research examining the intention to adopt I4.0 technologies for managing risks. Risk management identifies, assesses, and introduces responses for risks to avert crises. This study combines institutional theory, the resource-based view and the technology acceptance model to develop a novel behavioural model examining the adoption of big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and blockchain for risk management from the operations manager's perspective, which has never been examined in the literature. The model was tested for each I4.0 technology using data collected from 117 operations managers in the UK manufacturing industry which were analysed using structural equation modelling. We contribute to the theory on I4.0 in digital manufacturing by showing the impact of digital transformation maturity, market pressure, regulations, and resilience on the perceived usefulness and adoption of these technologies for managing risks in business operations. Based on the findings, we discuss implications for operations managers effectively and efficiently to adopt I4.0 technologies aiming to boost operational productivity.}

This paper aims to uncover how digitalization fundamentally transforms product companies in their transition towards services. Based on a systematic review of the literature, we analyze a sample of 180 articles published between 2005 and 2020 using both descriptive and content analysis techniques. Our review thereby offers both theoretical and managerial contributions. We descriptively analyze the evolution of the research field. Furthermore, we propose a new unified definition of digital servitization and discuss nine servitization dimensions where digitalization influences servitization—motivations; strategy; service offerings; structure; culture; resources and capabilities; processes; performance; and servitization ecosystems—leading to a new conceptual framework for digital servitization. Finally, we identify several directions for future digital servitization research.}

This article reviews the ethical and human rights challenges as well as proposed mitigation strategies, in order to the discuss how a regulatory body might be designed to address these challenges. It focuses on a particular form that a new body might take, more specifically on a potential European Agency for AI. Based on a multi-step methodology of stakeholder interaction, the article proposes a terms of reference for such an Agency and discusses the characteristics it would need to display to ensure that it could adequately engage with current and future ethical and human rights challenges arising from the development, deployment and use of AI.

Therefore, this article aims to identify the digitalization and ecosystem-related capabilities of manufacturers in the agricultural machinery industry that are seeking digital servitization and offering smart product-service systems. Moreover, it aims to uncover the relationships among these capabilities to determine their driving and dependence power. A combination of methods was employed to achieve this result. First, a systematic literature review was conducted to define key digitalization and ecosystem-related capabilities. Next, the Interpretive Structural Modelling and fuzzy MICMAC analysis were employed to define the capabilities’ driving power and dependence power. By combining these analyses, we propose a conceptual framework that integrates these two sets of capabilities, which is comprised of three macro-layers: driving, linkage, and dependent. This article contributes to the literature by showing the interrelationships between digitalization and ecosystem-related capabilities. Also, it proposes a conceptual framework that groups capabilities based on their contributions to the development of digital service innovation.}

To ensure potential affordances are leveraged and potential limitations and risks are identified and addressed, a structured approach for identifying opportunities and challenges for people, plant and procedures could be beneficial. A literature review revealed that for process safety management there is a gap associated with exploring the utility of frameworks that facilitate a structured approach for thinking about data, information, knowledge and wisdom from a people, plant and procedures perspective. This article explores work done to answer the research question – Can the data-information-knowledge-wisdom-action (DIKWA) cycle and people-plant-procedures (P3) model help identify important considerations associated with ‘Big Data’ applications within the process industries especially in terms of process safety management? We apply these frameworks to an industry case study on high temperature hydrogen attack and find that it revealed insights into options for and affordances and limitations associated with adopting ‘Big Data’ technology and tools. The implications of these insights for process safety management are discussed then recommendations are made about future research which includes the need to use this work to inform the development of a useful and usable knowledge processing model for process safety applications.}

The financial sector is exposed to a larger number of cyber attacks but suffers lower costs, on average. The use of cloud services is associated with lower costs, especially when cyber incidents are relatively small. As cloud providers become systemically important, cloud dependence is likely to increase tail risks. Finally, we document that higher expenditure on IT is associated with future reduced costs from cyber incidents.}

Up-to-date and comprehensive quality of service measurement techniques provide important information to the companies about the way customers perceive the quality and their service quality expectations. It is critical to measure the service quality for airline transportation, which is becoming more popular compared to other types of transportation and therefore increasing competition. In order to compete in the market and improve their service quality, companies should know their customers well and make improvements by analysing their expectations correctly. In this context, the SERVQUAL method is one of the frequently preferred and effective tools in service quality measurement. However, it is not possible to deal with the effects of radical changes such as the development and transformations of technology, events and trends under the influence of the world with the conventional SERVQUAL method. For this purpose, the traditional method consisting of five dimensions has been extended to nine dimensions by adding four more dimensions, namely Environment, Pandemic, Digital Technology and Information Systems. While it is possible to perform a more detailed service quality measurement with the proposed method, companies are provided with an effective and up-to-date tool to determine which dimensions are more important. In this study after structuring main dimensions and its inner levels hierarchically, Modified Delphi method is applied to a group of experts and the main criteria are evaluated with Best Worst Method and sub-criteria are evaluated with Interval-Valued Neutrosophic AHP method. After subjecting the criteria, whose importance are determined, to sensitivity analysis, the results obtained are evaluated in terms of airline transportation and recommendations are presented. In addition to the extended approach it proposes, this study is the most detailed research on airline service quality as far as we know.}

However, as more stakeholders enter these markets, criminals are exploiting their inadvertent security deficiencies to launder illicit funds or finance terrorism. This three-round policy Delphi study involved consultations with 52 experts from different industries and countries to understand future risk-prone technological developments, possible prevention measures and relevant stakeholders. Results highlight a range of money laundering and terrorist financing risks being enabled by advances in distributed ledger technologies (predominantly through cryptocurrencies), new payment methods and financial technology (FinTech). These threats include privacy-enhanced cryptoassets, transaction laundering, e-currencies and digital-only financial services. Findings also suggest that detection-based countermeasures (currently the primary preventative approach) can be coupled with more diverse countermeasures to increase effectiveness. However, the unique circumstances and constraints specific to different stakeholders will affect the nature, utility, and extent to which they can implement certain countermeasures. As such, a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to prevention is undesirable. Drawing on expert insight from the study, we propose a framework and a 3-point standard of implementation to motivate cost-effective, user-friendly, and innovation-friendly measures to improve suspicious activity detection and futureproof technologies before their criminal exploitation becomes mainstream.}

A systematic review of the literature has been performed to analyze the main topic, the pillars of sustainability mainly considered and last, the possible outfalls of Industry 4.0 on sustainability. From a theoretical point of view, this paper contributes to the systematization of literature at the intersection between Industry 4.0 and sustainability, while from a managerial point of view it sheds light on implications and opportunities arising from considering the outfalls of innovations coming from Industry 4.0 on sustainability and its pillars.}

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused huge and disruptive technological changes in the healthcare sector, transforming the way businesses and societies function. To respond to the global health crisis, there have been numerous innovation projects in the healthcare sector, including the fast design and manufacturing of personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical devices, and testing, treatment, and vaccine technologies. Many of these innovative activities happen beyond organizational boundaries with collaboration and open innovation. In this paper, we review the current literature on open innovation strategy during the pandemic and adopt the co-evolution view of business ecosystems to address the context of change. Based on a detailed exploration of the COVID-19-related technologies in the UK and global healthcare sectors, we identify the key emerging themes of open innovation in crisis. Further discussions are conducted in relation to each theme. Our results and analysis can help provide policy recommendations for the healthcare sector, businesses, and society to recover from the crisis.}

The vulnerabilities classified as high, medium, and low are based on a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The hacker can decide to act separately or to collaborate with the organization. Subsequently, the organization chooses to operate individually or cooperate with the hacker. The organization also has a budget limit to patch the vulnerabilities. The paper developed an algorithm to determine the Nash equilibria of the game and conducted a numerical analysis. It found that maximum cooperation occurred at the beginning of the game when both the organization and the hacker decided to cooperate.}

We take a corpus-driven critical discourse analysis to investigate the marketing language in the subscription e-mails and websites of six English-medium MOOC platforms. The analysis shows that the platforms use an array of promotional persuasion strategies, including advice-giving, autonomization and responsibilization of individuals and reinforce a self-betterment discourse to create marketable employees. Through the use of a distinct blend of higher education, marketing, and self-help discourses, the skills-oriented language explicitly references job insecurity and urges the individual to (re)build oneself tirelessly to remain demandable/marketable, neglecting an intellectual advancement angle. This ideology legitimizes the neoliberal demands for the enterprising-self and employability and feeds into one's fear of failure, ranking individuals in the society based on a value-adding/detracting practice.}

Fast transition to the much more flexible power grid enriched with renewable energies, micro-grid, and distributed energy resources has been considered as a straightforward solution to the customers’ high demand. Using smart equipment and renewable energies, electric power generation and storage through the power grid domains will be facilitated, which enables bi-directional energy and information flows. The power grid with such enhanced features is called Smart Grid (SG). Controlling and managing the diverse sets of variables in the SG requires precise measuring, monitoring, communicating, and analytic systems which increase the complexity of the grid. This complexity is the main barrier to the realization of the SG up to now. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) simplifies monitoring, communications, and data processing among smart things to connect to anything in the world. This motivates the SG stakeholders and researchers to proceed with the best way to exploit the IoT technologies in the SG. In this survey paper, we summarize various efforts in this regard to highlight the advantages of the IoT-enabled SG and its probable gaps. To this end, a comprehensive layered approach has been proposed in this paper to classify various applications of the IoT technologies in the SG. Investigating IoT opportunities in each architecture layer facilitates the role of each technology and its relationship with other technologies. Also, open issues and future measures for the realization of IoT-enabled SG have been discussed in the paper.}

This study reviews the effective decarbonization strategies in the context of Europe's climate neutral vision. Initially, the study analyzes the reasons for ever-increasing emissions and investigates the perception of decarbonization in line with various influencing factors such as population size, economic growth, energy intensity, emission intensity, innovation, affordability and time. Subsequently, an in-depth qualitative analysis is performed to force out the challenges that Europe faces in decarbonizing the heating sector from the aspects, such as using clean energy resources, effective heat energy conversion and management approaches. Sustainable approaches and practices are proposed to mitigate carbonization and to promote carbon sink in line with the major problems associated with various sectors such as building, energy, industry and transportation sector. Furthermore, the roles of digitalization in decarbonization are explored and the inherent challenges are also discussed. This study also reviews various decarbonization policies that can direct the governments' action to effectively make a transition towards a climate-neutral society. The key findings highlight that solar energy utilization in small-scale is relatively not preferable for heat energy conversion in Europe due to climatic conditions, while district heating network with bio- and geothermal energy resource highly favors clean heat transformation scenario. In addition, 3D printing has a prodigious role to reduce building lifecycle emissions and hybrid policies as well as reward-based policies yields better outcomes. Promoting hydrogen utilization and carbon capture storage and utilization technologies can pivot climate neutrality in the sectors that are difficult to decarbonize. On the other hand, it can be observed that more focus is provided to reduce emissions and significantly less attention is focused on carbon sink.}

The smart sustainable cities prefer a reliable IoT connectivity and data integration to meet the standard constraints of emerging computing paradigms with enabling techhnologies. The computing paradigms including cloud, fog, and edge are nowadays driving the technological advancement to enrich the features of the digital application (DApp) including interactive, intuitive, and personalized. DApp utilizes the essential characteristics of the enabling technologies such as heterogeneity, resource constraints, connectivity, and mobility to standardize the nature of smart intelligence via service agents. In the connection of massive IoT services, DApp involves continuous generation of IoT data over a dedicated gateway to offer extensive connectivity and improved access control. In the past, most of the existing mechanisms have primarily focused on security management for IoT networks to operate massive application services. However, a key issue of privacy-preserving for massive IoT is still challenging to ensure device protection. Importantly, the existing mechanisms fail to claim security efficiencies in terms of user anonymity and authentication key exchange using formal proof. Thus, this paper presents a seamless authentication framework with privacy-preserving (SAF-PP) protocol to deal with security and privacy issues of smart eHealth intelligence. The formal analysis proves that the proposed SAF-PP can adhere to significant security properties while improving the system efficiency rate. The performance analysis also shows that the proposed SAF-PP is more efficient in increasing the active users with an improved packet delivery ratio and network lifetime.}

We show that the impact of a firm's revenue is stronger (weaker) in the lower (upper) quantile of the cost distribution. This result suggests that mispricing may occur if small and large firms are priced using the average effect estimated by the traditional least squares approach. Using a novel dataset, our study is the first to take firm-specific security information into account. We find that firms with weaker security levels than the industry average are more likely to be exposed to large-cost events. Regarding data breaches, small or mid-size loss events are related to higher cost per breached record. We compare the premiums of a quantile-based insurance pricing scheme with those of a two-part generalized linear model and the Tweedie model to explore the usefulness of the quantile-based model in addressing heterogeneous effects of firm size. Our findings provide useful implications for cyber insurers and policymakers who wish to assess the impacts of firm-specific factors in pricing insurance and to estimate the cost of claims.}

abstract = {Summary
Cardiovascular diseases, which are the leading global cause of death, should increase by 40% by 2030, reaching close to 24 million deaths worldwide. Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder, ahead of conduction disturbances and ventricular arrhythmias. Studies estimate that 7.6 million people aged>65 years in the European Union had atrial fibrillation in 2016, and this figure is predicted to increase by 89% to 14.4 million by 2060. Recent innovations in cardiac arrhythmia care, such as cardiac device miniaturization and smart devices, might revolutionize the future of patient care. Yet, the level of adoption of these breakthroughs will depend on their acceptability by patients and healthcare professionals, and on the pace of transformation of the French healthcare system (encouraged by “Ma Santé 2022”). In this article, we detail the major trends that could impact patients with heart rhythm disorders and their healthcare professionals by 2030. Eight major trends and their associated effects on patient care and healthcare professionals’ practices were discussed: technical evolution of cardiac devices; digitalization of the healthcare system, and telecardiology; the rise of smart devices; the rise of “big data” and artificial intelligence; patient empowerment; evolution of healthcare; healthcare transformation with “Ma Santé 2022”; and new funding models. These “multidimensional” changes give us room in this study to outline two scenarios for the evolution of care of patients with heart rhythm disorders in the near future.
Résumé
Les maladies cardiovasculaires, première cause de mortalité mondiale, devraient augmenter de 40 % d’ici 2030 pour atteindre près de 24 millions de décès dans le monde. La fibrillation atriale est le trouble du rythme cardiaque le plus courant devant les troubles conductifs et les arythmies ventriculaires. Des études estiment que 7,6 millions de personnes de plus de 65 ans dans l’UE ont eu une fibrillation atriale en 2016 et ce chiffre augmentera de 89 % à 14,4 millions d’ici 2060. Des innovations récentes en rythmologie telles que la miniaturisation des dispositifs cardiaques ou leur caractère connecté pourraient révolutionner l’avenir des soins. Pourtant, le niveau d’adoption de ces avancées dépendra de l’acceptabilité par les patients et les professionnels, et du rythme de transformation de notre système de santé français (« Ma Santé 2022 »). Dans cet article, nous proposons de détailler les tendances qui pourraient impacter les patients atteints de troubles du rythme cardiaque et les professionnels d’ici 2030. Huit tendances se dégagent : innovation des dispositifs cardiaques ; télécardiologie ; appareils connectés ; essor du « big data » ; et de l’intelligence artificielle ; autonomisation des patients ; évolution des soins ; transformation du système de santé ; et nouveaux modes de financement.

The subject provides a theoretical foundation for developing countries like Pakistan, where digital technologies, unsatisfactory literacy rates, and low internet penetration exist. The study uses multiple linear regression models and found that digital literacy and digital media usage enablers influence digital sales and transactions in Pakistan. The practical implication of the finding can be linked with digital economy development in Pakistan in the form of the establishment of various new apps and businesses in transportation (Careem, Bykea), food (Foodpanda) and social media (TikTok).}

abstract = {Connected and automated mobility systems can revolutionize the movement of both people and goods. Numerous studies call for the rapid adoption of connected and automated vehicle technologies that will be capable of improving safety significantly and supporting the unprecedented future demand. Several global smart city initiatives have shown that cities prosper when infrastructures are connected seamlessly. Interconnections of information systems are now occurring in ways never previously imagined, with potentially dramatic outcomes. Growing demand due to population and economic growth, coupled with a lack of adequate transportation policies and investment, are overwhelming transportation systems. Without substantial technological progress supported by policy and investments, the transportation systems will face a “drifting toward gridlock” scenario, as it is already the case in many major urban centers around the world. In this chapter, we first present an overview of connected and automated mobility systems, including connected and automated vehicles, transportation infrastructure, transportation data, and several brief field reports. Second, we have presented policies and guidance on safety, communication, cooperative driving automation, cybersecurity and privacy, and navigation systems (GPS/GNSS) for connected and automated mobility. Third, we have covered policies for connected and automated mobility services and parking and land use. Finally, legislation and public perception are presented for improving user acceptance for new technologies such as connected and automated mobility systems.}

New technologies and solutions were developed and get invented which ease farmers’ daily life, help them and their partners to gain knowledge about farming processes and environmental interrelations. This knowledge leads to better decisions and contributes to increased farm productivity, resource efficiency, and environmental health. Along with numerous advantages, some negative aspects and dependencies risk seamless workflow of agricultural production. Therefore, this study presents the state of the art of digitization in agriculture and points out vulnerabilities in digitized farming processes. The most important are the lack of interoperability and the dependency on internet connection. Hence, requirements are posed to meet these vulnerabilities in future IT (information technology) systems resulting in successive levels of resilience that cover the individual needs of farms adjusted to their mobile and landline internet supply. These findings are incorporated in a conceptual framework for a highly digitized fictive farm. Resilience is ensured by decentralized storage and computing capacities and internet independent communication networks including cooperation with machinery rings and contractors.}

In this paper, we review contemporary advances in Zero Defect Manufacturing using structured literature review. We explore emergent themes and present important directions for future development in this continuously emerging field of research and practice. We highlight two specific Zero Defect Manufacturing strategy types: defect prevention, and defect compensation; as well as identify two important themes for future ZDM research, namely advancing ZDM research (particularly with a view to progressing from zero-defect processes to zero-waste value chain strategies) and overcoming the global application challenges of ZDM (with emphasis on cyber-security and the extension of defect prevention and compensation strategies to less explored manufacturing processes).}

Proposing and validating a contextualized comprehensive action determination model, we find that monetary value and convenience indirectly affect intention to use CERP, through attitude toward CERP, while attitude toward sustainability and online trading habit directly affect intention to use CERP. The results offer instruction for practitioners to develop appropriate solutions for boosting CERP use.}

abstract = {Although sustainability is the top agenda for most global organizations, the noteworthy progress in this realm is still invisible, mainly due to the absence of a robust framework and reliable empirical evidence. Higher Sustainable Organisational Performance (SOP) means the organization has attained effective and efficient control over the majority of business functions, leading to a sustainable competitive edge over the competitors and higher customer delight. Undoubtedly, Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has revolutionized the manufacturing industry and is expected to leverage SOP in times to come. In this context, the study of I4.0 risks reduction and I4.0 drivers needs urgent attention. Similarly, investigating the impact of I4.0 risks reduction and I4.0 adoption on SOP is overlooked in the current literature. Also, the mediating role of I4.0 adoption through I4.0 risks reduction on SOP is yet to be investigated, which has the potential to transform the existing business model into a progressive, viable, and sustainable model. This research has established a theoretical model grounded on Contingency and Dynamic Capability View (DCV) theory. The model has explored the scope of I4.0 adoption to SOP by considering I4.0 drivers impacting I4.0 adoption and I4.0 risks mitigations impacting I4.0 risks reduction and their influence on SOP. Total 15 hypotheses are tested using software packages SmartPLS 3.0 and SPSS v23.0 based on the 273 respondents' data from 221 manufacturing companies of India. The research found I4.0 adoption and I4.0 risks reduction positively drive SOP, and I4.0 adoption has a positive significant mediating effect on the relationship between I4.0 risks reduction and SOP. This study has the potential to support managers, decision-makers, and researchers to build, test, and validate similar models adding minor reforms and developing innovative and creative combinations of inherent capabilities and resources to realize the SOP in manufacturing companies. The study is unique as it has explored the link between I4.0 risks reduction, I4.0 adoption, SOP, I4.0 drivers, and I4.0 risks mitigations for the first time. In addition, the investigation on the mediating effect of I4.0 adoption in the relationship between I4.0 risks reduction and SOP is a pioneering contribution to the existing literature.}

Research that examines the role of modern technologies in supporting the transition from a linear economy to the CE is therefore highly needed. This article analyzes and classifies existing research at the intersection of the CE and the Internet of Things (IoT), as an enabling technology. While studies on both concepts have proliferated, there is a lack of research that systematizes the literature and clarifies the relationship between the IoT and the CE. In order to achieve this, we reviewed a total of 170 academic articles published between 2007 and 2021 from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Based on the coding of keywords, four categories can be identified: (1) IoT-related technologies in the CE context, (2) enablers of IoT in the CE, (3) barriers to IoT adoption in the CE, and (4) the impacts of the IoT on the sustainability of (circular) economies. The current study is the first attempt to use a keyword coding approach to better understand IoT research in the CE domain. The review findings identify important drivers and enablers and provide a structured framework for research in this field. Finally, this study highlights several research directions that may provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners.}

At the same time, in the context of novel possibilities that artificial intelligence (AI) brings to governments in terms of understanding and developing collective behavior analysis, important concerns related to citizens' privacy have emerged. In order to identify the main uses that governments make of AI and to define citizens' concerns about their privacy, in the present study, we undertook a systematic review of the literature, conducted in-depth interviews, and applied data-mining techniques. Based on our results, we classified and discussed the risks to citizens' privacy according to the types of AI strategies used by governments that may affect collective behavior and cause massive behavior modification. Our results revealed 11 uses of AI strategies used by the government to improve their interaction with citizens, organizations in cities, services provided by public institutions or the economy, among other areas. In relation to citizens' privacy when AI is used by governments, we identified 8 topics related to human behavior predictions, intelligence decision making, decision automation, digital surveillance, data privacy law and regulation, and the risk of behavior modification. The paper concludes with a discussion of the development of regulations focused on the ethical design of citizen data collection, where implications for governments are presented aimed at regulating security, ethics, and data privacy. Additionally, we propose a research agenda composed by 16 research questions to be investigated in further research.}

Moreover, there is no available probabilistic database of cyber threats for nuclear power plants. In this study the frequencies of cyber threats were estimated based on operating experience analysis. The operating experiences are grouped by their characteristics to suggest the list of cyber threats, and the frequency of each cyber threat is calculated by two-stage Bayesian updates. This research is significant because it is the first study on a probabilistic approach to estimate cyber threats. Furthermore, this research offers the advantage of being able to update the threat frequencies with additional data accumulation. We expect that this approach can also be applied to probabilistic safety assessment, which is the most widely used method for nuclear power plant risk assessment.}

We measure digitalization in terms of digital connectivity, uses of the internet, e-business, e-commerce, and e-government. We also employ nine indicators to capture the depth, access, and efficiency of financial markets, institutions, and both. By using different econometric techniques to a sample of 27 European countries, we demonstrate the positive influences of digitalization on the developments of both financial markets and institutions. Among all dimensions of digitalization, digitalization in the business and public sector and individuals’ digital skills play a critical role in financial developments, while those in consumption may hinder financialization. With a prevalence of digital transformation, digitalization more likely enhances the depth and efficiency of financialization but shrinks the access to financialization. Our study also suggests the importance of digital transformation in the business and public sector in augmenting the depth and efficiency of financial markets, while digitalization in public sectors is an essential factor in driving access to financial markets. By measuring the short-run and long-run impacts of digitalization, we show that e-commerce and e-government have a long-term beneficial influence on financial markets and financial institutions, respectively.}

This paper explored how artificial intelligence (AI) is being used in the smart city concept. From 2014 to 2021, we examined 133 articles (97% of Scopus and 73% of WoS) in healthcare, education, environment and waste management, agriculture, mobility and smart transportation, risk management, and security. Moreover, we observed that the healthcare (23% impact), mobility (19% impact), privacy and security (11% impact), and energy sectors (10% impact) have a more significant influence on AI adoption in smart cities. Since the epidemic hit cities in 2019, the healthcare industry has intensified its AI-based advances by 60%. According to the analysis, AI algorithms such as ANN, RNN/LSTM, CNN/R-CNN, DNN, and SVM/LS-SVM have a higher impact on the various smart city domains.}

This survey focuses on three major aspects of contemporary smart farming. First, it highlights various types of big data generated through smart farming and makes a broad categorization of such data. Second, this paper discusses a comprehensive set of typical applications of big data in smart farming. Third, it identifies and introduces the principal big data and machine learning techniques that are utilized in smart farming data analysis. In doing so, this survey also identifies some of the major, current challenges in smart farming big data analysis.This paper provides a discussion on potential pathways toward more effective smart farming through relevant analytics-guided decision making.}

The connected technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT) power the world we live in. IoT systems and devices are critical infrastructure—they provide a platform for social interaction, fuel the marketplace, enable the government, and control the home. Their increasing ubiquity and decision-making capabilities have profound implications for society. When humans are empowered by technology and technology learns from experience, a new kind of social contract is needed, one that specifies the roles and rules of engagement for a cyber-social world. In this paper, we describe the “impact universe,” a framework for assessing the impacts and outcomes of potential IoT social controls. Policymakers can use this framework to guide technological innovation so that the design, use, and oversight of IoT products and services advance the public interest. As an example, we develop an impact universe framework that describes the social, economic, and environmental impacts of self-driving cars.}

The use of “omics” has become widespread across poultry production, from breeding to management to bird health to food safety and everywhere in between.  While the conventional poultry industry has become more exposed to the power and utility of “omic” technologies, smaller poultry flock producers typically do not have this same level of experience. Because smaller, nonconventional poultry production is a growing portion of the overall poultry market, it is important that they also have educational access to these research tools and the resultant data. While small flock producers are dedicated and knowledgeable farmers, their knowledge of these newer technologies may be limited at best, and it is the task of academic researchers to communicate the importance of these “omic” tools and how the omic data can improve a variety of different aspects of their operations. This review discusses ways to effectively communicate complex microbiota and microbial genome sequence data to small flock producers and transforming this data into meaningful and applicable information that they can utilize to inform beneficial management decisions.}

Machine learning has demonstrated a capability to detect patterns when other methodologies have collapsed. One advanced method to enhance IoT security is to employ deep learning. This formulates a seamless option for anomaly-based detection. This paper presents a CNN-based approach for anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) that takes advantage of IoT's power, providing qualities to efficiently examine whole traffic across the IoT. The proposed model shows ability to detect any possible intrusion and abnormal traffic behavior.

abstract = {Attackers are increasingly using Fast Flux Service Networks (FFSNs), networks of compromised machines, to host phishing websites. In FFSNs, the machines rapidly change such that blacklisting them does not entirely stop the networks from operating the websites. This increases the longevity of the websites thus becoming more harmful. Existing solutions for detecting the websites are limited with relatively low or moderate prediction performances, high prediction time and use of less diversified features which increases their susceptibility to detection evasions. This paper proposes a Machine Learning (ML) based approach for detecting phishing websites hosted in FFSNs using a novel set of 56 features. Compared with previous works, the approach achieves high accuracy, a low detection time and uses highly diversified features to enhance resilience to detection evasion. The effectiveness of the features for prediction was evaluated in the context of binary and multi-class classification tasks using multiple traditional and deep learning ML algorithms. The proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 98.42% and 97.81% for binary and multi-class classification tasks respectively. Our results showed that temporal and DNS based features are the strongest predictors while network and host related features are the weakest. Our approach is a significant step towards tracking of core components of FFSNs with an aim of shutting down the entire phishing ecosystem.}

This paper conceptualizes the cloud supply chain as a new and distinct research area. Through analysis of practical cases, we deduce some generalized characteristics of the cloud supply chain. In the generalised model, we formalize supply chain multi-structural dynamics and dynamic service composition. Our results show that the main generalized characteristics of the cloud supply chain are related to (i) multi-structural dynamics; (ii) platforms, digital supply chains, ecosystems, and visibility, (iii) dynamic service composition with dynamically changing buyer/supplier roles, (iv) resilience and viability, and (v) intertwined supply networks and circular economy.

Such issues become highly evident in the online communication of social activist groups. Through interviews with members of several such groups, this paper examines how collective privacy is constructed, managed, negotiated, and enacted. The particular strategies for collective privacy employed by each group emerged from a confluence of the group's defining characteristics and core values, the dynamics of interactions within the group, and the group's relationships with people and entities external to it. After articulating how collective privacy differs from and builds upon previous conceptualizations of privacy, the paper concludes with implications for designing socio-technological tools that enable and facilitate protection of collective privacy especially for sensitive or vulnerable online groups.}

The current industry standard approach towards vulnerability management at a large scale is limited for two reasons. First, it does not automatically capture the temporal characteristics of the Common Vulnerability Exposures (CVEs) (i.e., how CVEs change over time). Second, it requires manual labor to prioritize identified vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, this research designs a context-aware vulnerability prioritization (CAVP) model to calculate temporal-enabled vulnerability scores of CVEs and prioritize these vulnerabilities visually. The CAVP model includes an enhanced Context-Aware Vulnerability Scoring System (CAVSS) that automatically derives temporal metric values of CVEs through a set of expert-validated heuristic rules. The CAVP model is the first attempt to provide a step-by-step process of vulnerability prioritization that can be integrated within the risk management workflow of an organization. The implementation of the CAVP model in two organizations validates its usefulness.}

Overcoming these conditions requires a change in traditional methods of urban management and a move toward the use of new technologies in all pillars of urban management. One of the available solutions is to create or develop smart cities to take advantage of new digital capacities and rely on the principles of industry 4.0 to manage complex situations and prevent possible anomalies. In this book chapter, the evolution of smart cities platforms along with industrial revolutions is reviewed, and the key points of policies applicable in the field of smart cities using industry 4.0 (city 4.0) are stated. Simultaneous attention to the financial effects and smart cities policy in the fourth generation of the different industrial revolution is the key highlight of this chapter that can be considered by policymakers in creating or developing smart cities.}

In this context, digital servitization requires the actors involved to perform new roles and develop new capabilities. Although servitization actor capabilities in the digital transformation context have been addressed in prior studies, the literature lacks a detailed understanding of how they operate according to different service types and different actor roles. Through a systematic literature review, our study aims to expound the capabilities required for digital servitization, for Base, Intermediate, and Advanced services, and analyze who of the main actors of the service triad (manufacturer, intermediaries, and customer) should own such capabilities. This analysis resulted in a final sample of 47 main articles addressing capabilities. We show how the structure of the service triad shifts the digital service provision based on the capabilities required by each actor. For instance, Base Services demand less capabilities, thus, intermediary actors play a less important role since they just execute services usually on behalf of a manufacturer in a more discrete capacity. For Intermediate Services, the intermediary actor becomes more important, with capabilities needed to deliver the digital solution. In Advanced Services, customers' relationships with manufacturers become stronger, as this actor reassumes a central role in the solution offer, and intermediaries move to a supporting role again. Our analysis offers propositions for future research on digital servitization and practical implications on the capabilities required.}

Industry 4.0 has the potential to fulfil customized requirements during the COVID-19 emergency crises. The development of a prediction framework can help health authorities to react appropriately and rapidly. Clinical imaging like X-rays and computed tomography (CT) can play a significant part in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 patients that will help with appropriate treatment. The X-ray images could help in developing an automated system for the rapid identification of COVID-19 patients. This study makes use of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract significant features and discriminate X-ray images of infected patients from non-infected ones. Multiple image processing techniques are used to extract a region of interest (ROI) from the entire X-ray image. The ImageDataGenerator class is used to overcome the small dataset size and generate ten thousand augmented images. The performance of the proposed approach has been compared with state-of-the-art VGG16, AlexNet, and InceptionV3 models. Results demonstrate that the proposed CNN model outperforms other baseline models with high accuracy values: 97.68% for two classes, 89.85% for three classes, and 84.76% for four classes.

abstract = {The circular economy (CE) has the potential to capitalise upon emerging digital technologies, such as big data, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain and the Internet of things (IoT), amongst others. These digital technologies combined with business model innovation are deemed to provide solutions to myriad problems in the world, including those related to circular economy transformation. Given the societal and practical importance of CE and digitalisation, last decade has witnessed a significant increase in academic publication on these topics. Therefore, this study aims to capture the essence of the scholarly work at the intersection of the CE and digital technologies. A detailed analysis of the literature based on emerging themes was conducted with a focus on illuminating the path of CE implementation. The results reveal that IoT and AI play a key role in the transition towards the CE. A multitude of studies focus on barriers to digitalisation-led CE transition and highlight policy-related issues, the lack of predictability, psychological issues and information vulnerability as some important barriers. In addition, product-service system (PSS) has been acknowledged as an important business model innovation for achieving the digitalisation enabled CE. Through a detailed assessment of the existing literature, a viable systems-based framework for digitalisation enabled CE has been developed which show the literature linkages amongst the emerging research streams and provide novel insights regarding the realisation of CE benefits.}

The last decade has witnessed significant endeavors in striking a balance between ethical considerations and health transformation led by AI. Despite a growing interest in AI ethics, implementing AI-related technologies and initiatives responsibly in healthcare settings remains a challenge. In response to this topical challenge, we reviewed 253 articles pertaining to AI ethics in healthcare published between 2000 and 2020, summarizing the coherent themes of responsible AI initiatives. A preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) approach was employed to screen and select articles, and a hermeneutic approach was adopted to conduct systematic literature review. By synthesizing relevant knowledge from AI governance and ethics, we propose a responsible AI initiative framework that encompasses five core themes for AI solution developers, healthcare professionals, and policy makers. These themes are summarized in the acronym SHIFT: Sustainability, Human centeredness, Inclusiveness, Fairness, and Transparency. In addition, we unravel the key issues and challenges concerning responsible AI use in healthcare, and outline avenues for future research.}

We examine how an informative white paper content signal and a concurrent potentially biased expert rating signal correlate with measures of ICO funding success, ICO underpricing, and post-ICO performance. Our empirical results suggest that high-quality ICO issuers signal their type by providing more informative white paper content, i.e., excess or new textual information not contained in recent and peer white papers. However, investors rely on the expert ratings signal in their decision to buy tokens that “jams” the white paper informative content signal. Once listed tokens receive a market valuation, white paper informative content is positively associated with our measures for underpricing, returns, and liquidity, while the expert ratings signal is rendered irrelevant.}

The purpose is to develop a predictive model for building energy planning to balance the supply from renewable power systems and the building electrical load demand). For the methodology, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was used as a machine learning approach for building energy forecasting. The data for training (80%), testing (10%), and validation (10%) was used from smart energy meters installed in the building and weather data. A total of 20520 dataset instances was used for developing the forecasting model. The originality of this study is the ANFIS model was validated for the training, testing, and validation data, and the accuracy and reliability of the forecasting model was assessed over various very short time horizon of past data (0.5–4 h ahead). The main results reveal that the predictive model is extremely accurate in predicting the energy consumption of a building. The values of coefficient of correlation R for training, testing, and validation are 0.98017, 0.9778, and 0.97593, respectively, for the 30 min ahead energy forecasting. The R values for all the data are respectively 0.97951, 09854, and 0,96778 for the 0.5, 1, 4 h ahead energy forecasting. The low nMSE and nMAE errors for the ANFIS model demonstrate how well the model replicates the reported results from smart energy meters. The research findings are very important for the energy planning of microgrid power systems (energy purchase, building operations and maintenance, and demand side management).}

abstract = {There is a need to identify key existing and emerging issues relevant to digitalisation in agricultural production that would benefit from a stronger evidence base and help steer policy formulation. To address this, a prioritisation exercise was undertaken to identify priority research questions concerning digital agriculture in the UK, but with a view to also informing international contexts. The prioritisation exercise uses an established and effective participatory methodology for capturing and ordering a wide range of views. The method involves identifying a large number of participants and eliciting an initial long list of research questions which is reduced and refined in subsequent voting stages to select the top priorities by theme. Participants were selected using purposive sampling and snowballing to represent a number of sectors, organisations, companies and disciplines across the UK. They were each invited to submit up to 10 questions according to certain criteria, and this resulted in 195 questions from a range of 40 participants (largely from England with some representation from Scotland and Wales). Preliminary analysis and clustering of these questions through iterative analysis identified seven themes as follows: data governance; data management; enabling use of data and technologies; understanding benefits and uptake of data and technologies; optimising data and technologies for performance; impacts of digital agriculture; and new collaborative arrangements. Subsequent stages of voting, using an online ranking exercise and a participant workshop for in-depth discussion, refined the questions to a total of 27 priority research questions categorised into 15 gold, 7 silver and 5 bronze, across the 7 themes. The questions significantly enrich and extend previous clustering and agenda setting using literature sources, and provide a range of new perspectives. The analysis highlights the interconnectedness of themes and questions, and proposes two nexus for future research: the different dimensions of value, and the social and institutional arrangements to support digitalisation in agriculture. These emphasise the importance of interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity, and the need to tackle the binary nature of current analytical frames. These new insights are equally relevant to contexts outside the UK. This paper highlights the need for research actions to inform policy, not only instrumentally by strengthening the evidence base, but also conceptually, to prompt new thinking. To our knowledge this methodology has not been previously applied to this topic.}

Digitalization as a business enabler has speeded and scaled innovation in many firms. As the corporate leader, the CEO facilitates strategic agility and enhances network effects to create value. This study uses innovation efficiency as the proxy of digitalization to examine the contribution of the CEO networks to firm-level innovation efficiency in Chinese listed firms. Using 13,516 firm-year observations in Chinese listed high-tech firms between 2007 and 2017, we apply a frontier analysis approach (e.g., DEA and SFA) and measure innovation efficiency based on the scale ratio of innovation output (i.e., patent counts) and input (R&D investment and R&D personnel). First, we find that innovation is more efficient when CEO has more outside directorships. Second, a significant and positive relationship exists between a well-connected CEO and innovation efficiency when the newly appointed CEO has larger networks than the predecessor. Third, the positive relationship between a well-connected CEO and innovation efficiency disappears when the number of outside directorships is above the yearly median level. This empirical study provides evidence for the network effects of a CEO for improving innovation efficiency. The findings emphasize the contingent value of the CEO's external social capital on agility, especially the multiple directorships in a transitional economy.}

Our research is addressing two objectives. The first objective is to identify the main determinants affecting the adoption of e-government and its use by seniors. The second objective is to build a research framework for assessing e-government policy for the digital inclusion of the seniors from both social and technical perspectives.

This paper presents the results of a study aimed at assessing the level of business digital maturity in Europe and at analyzing similarities between companies in terms of implemented Industry 4.0 technologies. The digital transformation of production and service enterprises has become a common direction of development for all economic sectors. The very idea of Industry 4.0 has become synonymous with innovation and is the basis for business development. The role and importance of these transformations are also recognized by the EU which has been promoting and supporting the development of an innovative digital economy for many years. However, individual EU countries differ in terms of digital business maturity due to the implementation of Industry 4.0 technology. The article addresses this problem by presenting the results of a comprehensive study of the implementation of Industry 4.0 digital technologies in enterprises in the EU-27 countries and by assessing similarities between these countries in terms of these technologies. The similarity analysis was carried out using the k-means method. The Gini coefficient and Lorenz curves were utilized to determine the unevenness of the implementation of these technologies in individual countries, and the Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment method was used to assess the level of digital maturity. The research was based on eight selected determinants (indicators) that characterize the most important technologies related to Industry 4.0. The results showed high diversity among EU countries in terms of digital maturity. Scandinavian countries (Finland and Denmark) and Malta were found to be leaders in this area, while the weakest results were reported for Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Latvia. The findings provide a lot of new information about the current state of development of the digital economy in EU countries, which should be used in both the development and implementation of new solutions related to economic digitalization policy in this region.}

abstract = {Agriculture is considered one of the most important sectors that play a strategic role in ensuring food security. However, with the increasing world's population, agri-food demands are growing — posing the need to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices, also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things, and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover, it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally, potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities.}

Their increasing convergence into digital servitization leads to tensions both within and between organizations. The authors investigate such intra- and interorganizational tensions by applying a paradox theory lens. The study draws on 56 depth interviews and multiple site visits from two cases in the aerospace and maritime industries. Linked to the paradoxes of organizing, learning, belonging, and performing, eight tensions emerge from the findings. The intra-organizational tensions include digitally enabled control, digital upkeep, professional identity, and performance priorities. In turn, the interorganizational tensions comprise platform-based coopetition, information superabundance, organizational identity, and data utilization. For practitioners working with digital services, this study suggests an audit of tensions to inform continued formulations of a mitigation strategy.}

Indicative examples in this category are advanced applications like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data Analytics (BDA), Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT), which are already influencing the maritime industry. It is indicative of the fact that there are several construction projects of autonomous ships, such as the Yara Birkeland and the Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS), which are heavily reliant on technologies associated with the Industry 4.0 concept. The maritime transport industry is already transitioning into a new operations paradigm, often termed as “shipping in the era of digitalization”. Shipping companies promote digitalization as the future of the maritime industry and their efforts to set up strategies are already in progress. Examining those visions and strategies in relation to digitalization would be beneficial to better understand the way towards which the maritime industry is heading. This paper is aiming to identify the characteristics of that pool of future plans via a qualitative review and with a particular focus on major maritime commercial actors, based on shipping companies' relevant action plans that were gathered online. A conclusion standing out is that major shipping companies have embraced digitalization to increase cost-efficiency, raise competitiveness and meet the needs of their customers.}

Since then, countries have moved rapidly to digitise their health information systems. Soon, however, most governments who adopted digitisation began encountering challenges with interoperability hampering timely and accurate decision-making. The Asia eHealth Information Network was created by WHO in 2011 to form a group of peers collaborating to solve this interoperability problem. After 9 years of continuous knowledge exchange and resource sharing, AeHIN has arrived at a framework to guide countries in developing their national eHealth programme. This framework is the ‘Mind the GAPS’ approach. GAPS is an acronym representing the foundational importance of multisectoral governance (G) in setting the strategy and directions for eHealth development in the country. This governance structure then broadly promotes a shared enterprise architecture (A) with stakeholders who in turn adopt good programme management (P) practices to build their part of the blueprint. By implementing the standards (S) in the blueprint, stakeholders contribute to interoperability within a country and corollary, to the region.}

Firms accelerated their digitalization efforts during the global pandemic to an emergency speed. This speed of implementation of digital technologies left organizations with little time to adapt their structures, processes, and culture to the new environment. We argue that firms currently remain in a stretched operations mode that will either bounce back to normal after the pandemic or ultimately lead to organizational failure. Seven in-depth case studies based on 11 interviews of top management support our argument and show that, during this crisis, firms have been operating in a state of exception. We take an organizational elasticity perspective to investigate this status and develop an agenda for firms to facilitate sustainable digital transformation. Our study provides important insights into organizational elasticity as a framework to manage the long-term organizational impact of the current pandemic.}

abstract = {This study analyzes the effect of stablecoin adoption on key macroeconomic factors in Montenegro. The main explanation for the adoption of stablecoins is their one-to-one peg to various currencies and commodities. Previous studies have relied on the relationships among cryptocurrencies and thus could not disentangle the country-level macroeconomic effects of stablecoins from the effects of other cryptocurrencies. Using data from January 2006 to December 2019, we decompose the correlation between cryptocurrencies and their effects on the economy due to (a) shocks to stablecoins and (b) shocks to Bitcoin. Contrary to assumptions, stablecoins do not maintain their peg in “crash times” but do promote economic growth. Bitcoin's volatility deanchors investor expectations, disrupts markets, and destabilizes key macroeconomic factors. Our novel findings indicate that stablecoin adoption should not be based only on a one-to-one assumption and reveal the mechanism of key gaps by a prudential authority.}

abstract = {The forces of digital transformation have delivered significant benefits like sustainable development and economic growth in a range of early adopter industries such as retail and manufacturing but, despite these potential benefits, the resource and energy sectors have been relative latecomers to digitalization simply because they are frequently slower to absorb new technologies. Here we present the results of a systematic literature review identifying the ways in which digital technologies have been applied in the oil and gas, mining, and energy domains. We applied content and descriptive analysis to evaluate and discuss 151 academic articles selected from the Scopus database. Two particularly interesting trends emerge from the analysis. First, over 75% of the papers were about the energy sector excluding the oil & gas industry, and only a small minority were from the mining or oil & gas sectors. Second, the most frequently discussed objective of digital transformation was the reduction of operational expenses. By surveying the different ways in which these innovations have been used in these industries and identifying trends and patterns in how digital technologies have been applied, the findings of this review deepen our understanding of the current state of digital technologies within the resource and energy sectors and, in so doing, shine a useful amount of light on the contributions that digital transformation has made to businesses in these sectors. This paper also highlights for future scholars, practitioners, and policymakers the six research areas that they should focus on in the future to help the resource and energy sectors accelerate the digital transformation process and improve their ability to deliver value with these innovations.}

New state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) technologies are integral in optimizing decision-making in energy distribution networks and systems. This study was conducted on data-driven probabilistic ML techniques and their real-time applications to smart energy systems and networks to highlight the urgency of this area of research. This study focused on two key areas: i) the use of ML in core energy technologies and ii) the use cases of ML for energy distribution utilities. The core energy technologies include the use of ML in advanced energy materials, energy systems and storage devices, energy efficiency, smart energy material manufacturing in the smart grid paradigm, strategic energy planning, integration of renewable energy, and big data analytics in the smart grid environment. The investigated ML area in energy distribution systems includes energy consumption and price forecasting, the merit order of energy price forecasting, and the consumer lifetime value. Cybersecurity topics for power delivery and utilization, grid edge systems and distributed energy resources, power transmission, and distribution systems are also briefly studied. The primary goal of this work was to identify common issues useful in future studies on ML for smooth energy distribution operations. This study was concluded with many energy perspectives on significant opportunities and challenges. It is noted that if the smart ML automation is used in its targeting energy systems, the utility sector and energy industry could potentially save from $237 billion up to $813 billion.}

Users must place great trust in their bank branches—a necessary feature of relationships between banking institutions and their clients. Banks’ reputation also directly affects their success, ability to attract new customers, and retention of existing ones. These issues mean that making decisions regarding how to deal with the challenges of incorporating artificial intelligence (AI), digital transformation and cybersecurity into the banking sector is quite complex.
