abstract = {The circular economy has emerged as a key driver in the development of sustainability in the current digital world. Circular economy businesses have generated significant contributions in terms of gross domestic product and employment. In the future, new approaches are needed that meet global trends in digitalisation, resources, and ecological challenges. Instead of solely addressing environmental issues, e-businesses in the digital age need to ensure the sustainable development of the circular economy. This paper proposes a feature-based circular economy e-business model for uplifting environment, social, and governance (ESG) and sustainability performance. We have employed indicators that support the implementation of the circular economy process related to technical aspects, reduce the cost of operation and resource pressure, minimise the environmental impact, and maximise social and economic impacts. We present here a comprehensive discussion that provides an in-depth literature review, an emerging e-business model for the circular economy, business, e-business application portfolio, and software application development for sustainable circular economy Business.}

Unlike previous work on direct users of AI, this study focuses on the general public. Two online survey experiments presented participants with information on six types of ethical AI measures: legal compliance, ethics-by-design measures, data-gathering limitations, human-in-the-loop, non-discrimination, and technical robustness. Results reveal that general ethical AI information has little to no effect on trust, perceived trustworthiness or policy support among citizens. Prior attitudes and experiences, including privacy concerns, trust in government, and trust in AI, instead form good predictors. These findings suggest that short-term communication efforts on ethical AI practices have minimal impact. The findings suggest that a more long-term, comprehensive approach is necessary to building trust in governmental AI projects, addressing citizens' underlying concerns and experiences. As governments' use of AI becomes more ubiquitous, understanding citizen responses is crucial for fostering trust, perceived trustworthiness and policy support for AI-based policies and initiatives.}

However, following the recent COVID-19 pandemic crisis, distributors have been seeking to become more agile in identifying and transforming business processes to avoid failures. Although industrial practitioners have been broadly motivated to understand the effects of pandemics on business failure, the contingency factors that affect organizations in their responses to such sudden exogenous shocks remain unclear. Inspired by a burgeoning academic interest in viewing the COVID-19 pandemic as a digital accelerator, this paper examines how B2B distribution firms have been avoiding business failure by using their dynamic capabilities (DCs) in response to the sudden exogenous shocks caused by the pandemic. Based on data drawn from interviews conducted with a sample of B2B distribution firms, we argue that capitalizing on digital DCs—digital sensing (i.e., digital mindset crafting and digital scenario planning), digital seizing (i.e., engaging in strategic agility and balancing a digital portfolio), and digital transformation (i.e., navigating the innovation ecosystem, redesigning the internal structure, and improving digital maturity), —helps to prevent business failure during a pandemic.}

In this review, the fundamentals of IoT-based systems and recent developments in their use in agriculture and food supply chain are explained. Based on the literature, examples of successful applications of IoT-based systems for irrigation efficiency, pesticide treatments, supply chain management etc. are given. Nowadays, there is a great demand for the integration of IoT-based systems into the present agricultural practices and supply chains and it seems to increase exponentially. Experts in electronics and computer sciences have achieved noteworthy success in the simulations. On the other hand, only a few studies have been conducted in real agricultural and food systems. However, IoT-based systems should be tested on-site and their success in practical applications should be proved. It is obvious that new era will be one in which IoT-based technologies and their tools will be more commonly used in agriculture and food supply.}

Despite its proclaimed effectiveness in supply chain (SC) management, empirical studies examining the effects of Industry 4.0 adoption on SC resilience have been underrepresented in the current OM literature. In our study, we explore the effects of 16 Industry 4.0 technologies and IT advancement concerning SC resilience through the mediating roles of SC capabilities with respect to SC collaboration and SC visibility. Following the dynamic resource-based view (RBV), we regard Industry 4.0 adoption and IT advancement as two important IT resources with heterogeneity, SC collaboration and SC visibility as essential SC dynamic capabilities, and SC resilience as competitive advantages. We suggest the combination and evolution of IT resources and dynamic SC capabilities helps firms obtain the competitive advantage regarding SC resilience. Using data from a survey of 408 Chinese manufacturing firms, we reveal Industry 4.0 adoption is positively related to IT advancement and that Industry 4.0 has a nonsignificant impact on SC capabilities, whereas IT advancement has a positive impact on SC capabilities. Additionally, both SC collaboration and visibility positively influence SC resilience and significantly mediate the impacts of Industry 4.0 and IT advancement on SC resilience. Our study offers an enhanced understanding of the specific flows between Industry 4.0 and SC resilience and provides nuanced insights for both literature and practice.}

abstract = {Rapid design and construction of mobile cabin hospitals (MCHs) have become imperative in the COVID-19 response. However, due to unique design specifications (e.g., parallel design and model pre-revision), collaboration in emergency construction projects (ECPs) like MCHs presents data security vulnerabilities, including a lack of traceability and transparency. These hazards invariably reduce design effectiveness, leading to undesirable rework and project delay. Blockchain technology is a potential solution to address the aforementioned security issues in ECPs because it offers immutable and traceable data storage. Nevertheless, directly implementing blockchain in ECPs is impractical, for the blockchain has a complex deployment process and provides limited functions supporting BIM-based design. Therefore, this paper develops a lightweight blockchain-as-a-service (LBaaS) prototype to enhance the ECPs design efficiency by securing and automating information exchange while eliminating the difficulties of deploying and using blockchain. This paper contributes three elements: (1) Security vulnerabilities of design in ECP are identified. Taking an MCH in Hong Kong as an example, this paper investigates its design process and determines two design characteristics and associated security flaws. (2) Key technologies to support easy deployment and usage of blockchain in ECPs are developed. New technical elements, including a Multi-to-One mapping (MtOM) kit for easy blockchain registration, an integrated workflow retaining existing design practices, and smart contracts for secure interaction with blockchain, are developed to support LBaaS functionality. (3) An LBaaS prototype is validated and evaluated. The prototype is illustrated and evaluated using design examples based on actual MCH project data. Results show that the LBaaS is a feasible and secure approach for ECPs collaboration. This paper deepens the understanding of data security issues in ECPs and offers technical guidance in establishing blockchain solutions.}

This paper analyzes the “visions” put forward in Germany from smart home industry actors, users in smart homes and policymakers and the processes through which legitimacy for the smart home is created. When it comes to digital energy futures, the multiple ways in which visions legitimize the uptake of emerging technologies belong to the driving forces in institutionally stabilizing sociotechnical imaginaries. We identify legitimation strategies that can be found within those visions. Our analyzes are empirically based on a qualitative content analysis of smart home marketing websites from the ten most common smart home providers in Germany and on policy documents from German ministries, as well as on qualitative interviews with German smart home users. We discovered four different legitimation strategies that contribute to institutionally stabilizing emerging German smart home imaginaries: cognitive/emotional alignment, solutionism, coupling with normative goals and expert/scientific legitimation. Our findings reveal how visions that, in their formation phase, are shared only between small actor collectives gain traction through several legitimation strategies.}

It attempts to present the politics of urban design, rejecting an urban-technological determinism that refers to a specific technical environment as the only one possible. If technology is an open process with social implications and consequences, the same holds for urban technologies and designs. This approach argues that contemporary cities are formed within a specific socio-technical context which is seemingly the most functional for the current social, political and economic world, but since environmental and urban crises rise, there seems to be a need for rethinking over the form of current cities. Thus, this article attempts to offer a theoretical contribution to the debate over alternative urban designs through Andrew Feenberg's insights. Drawing upon some of his most crucial notions, like the “technical code”, the “interpretative flexibility” and the “operational autonomy” and presenting their role in a philosophy of the city, I attempt to highlight that current urban forms could be replaced by other functional alternatives. The choice over one or another urban design is political hence the need for the relation between the philosophy of the city and technical politics.}

The study is based on the comparison of two simulation scenarios in a cheese supply chain, the as-is case vs. the integration of the following technologies: blockchain, smart contracts, RFID and IoT. Using the Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing method, costs are allocated for six actors: dairy farm, 3PL, wholesaler and three retailers. In addition, the costs of each player are allocated for each supply chain area: logistics, warehouse and order management. The study shows in which areas and for which actors implementing and integrating different technologies is economically suitable. Different procurement policies are modelled for evaluating the cost impacts for each retailer: Economic Order Quantity, Period Order Quantity and Lot for Lot. Moreover, the costs of non-compliant products are assessed in both scenarios. The results show that specific areas such as warehouse management and logistics in the to-be scenario are not economically optimized, however the entire supply chain cost is optimized. The area with positive economic feasibility for all the participants in the supply chain is order management. The combined use of technologies is economically beneficial when the Economic Order Quantity procurement policy is adopted. Finally, in the to-be scenario the non-compliant products management is economically optimized with economic benefits ranging from 8% to 63%.}

While technology enables I-business firms to internationalize at a faster pace, unfamiliarity and uncertainty of distant host countries may still affect their location choice. Further, we identify two firm-level contingencies – direct network externalities and engagement in business-to-business transactions – that condition the effect of cross-national distances on the location choice decision. Using a global data set of 185 I-business firms, we find that cultural, geographic and economic distances negatively impact the location choice. While direct network externalities strengthen the negative relationship between certain types of distance and location choice, a business-to-business (B2B) model weakens that relationship.

Blockchain technology (BCT) has gained significant attention due to undertake the decentralization, transparency, spectrum resource scarcity, inherent privacy and security, interoperability, confidentiality, and emerging smart applications domains including Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Industry 5.0 applications. The mismatch between the requirements of many data intensive disruptive IoT applications and 5G network capabilities steered the demand of decentralized BCT based 6G architecture. Inspired by these facts, this paper studies an extensive survey to draw a new direction of blockchain integration into 6G mobile networks, IoT technologies, and smart industries in terms of infrastructure sharing, computational loads, latency, bandwidth overhead, business model, sustainability goals, and edge intelligence focusing the potential merits and challenges.

The adopted research procedure is also an added value because it could be replicated in other context scenarios. To achieve this paper's aim, the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and survey research among authorities in 414 Polish cities were carried out. As a result, a list of 15 challenges and preventive activities proposed by researchers to prevent these challenges have been identified. Empirical verification of identified challenges allows us to determine which of them limit AI adoption to the greatest extent in public managers' opinion. These include a lack of strategy or plans to initial adoption / continued usage of AI; no ensuring that AI is used in line with human values; employees' insufficient knowledge of how to use AI; insufficient AI policies, laws, and regulations; and different expectations of stakeholders and partners about AI. These findings could help practitioners to prioritize AI adoption activities and add value to digital government theory.}

The review highlights an emerging trend of the role of machine learning- and artificial intelligence-based approaches in identifying and preventing domestic violence. However, we argue that little recommendation is available to professionals about how to use these approaches in a responsible way, and that the smartness of high-tech technologies is often challenged by basic-level technologies from perpetrators, creating an imbalance that also limits an impactful development of a comprehensive socio-technical regime that serves the safety and resilience of families in their communal setting.}

abstract = {Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) is rapidly growing up while encountering severe security threats simultaneously. DDoS attacks tend to disrupt large-scale sensing tasks to the MCS and reduce the availability of MCS. However, the existing centralized defense technology has the problem of high cost and the existing research lacks the application of distributed cooperative characteristics of MCS. A crowd cooperative defense model for mitigating DDoS attacks in MCS is proposed based on these. Firstly, the crowdsensing networks are formally described. The cooperative mechanism of sensing nodes participating in overlapping sensing coalition is generalized, which breaks the independence between the distributed sensing nodes and enables the sensing nodes to cooperate against DDoS attacks. Then, the crowd cooperative defense problem is transformed into a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem. A multi-objective discrete Harris Hawk optimization (MODHHO) algorithm is designed. The algorithm applies non-dominated sorting and crowding strategy to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each cooperative defense solution on the cooperative defense objectives. In addition, the global exploration, local exploitation, and besiege phases are used to continuously update the cooperative defense solutions, and finally obtains the global optimal cooperative defense solution after a certain number of iterations. The simulation results show that the proposed model can minimize the defense cost compared to non-cooperative and non-overlapping sensing coalition methods. Compared with centralized defense, the loss cost of the proposed model is reduced by 61.8%. In addition, the average throughput of the sensing network is increased by 35.5%, which enhances the availability of the sensing network.}

The supply chain factors studied include supply chain collaboration, information sharing along the supply chain, partner power, trust in supply chain partners and Guanxi with supply chain partners. We choose the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework as the benchmark model and quantify the importance of supply chain factors by comparing the prediction accuracy of the benchmark model using only the TOE framework with an extended model combining supply chain factors with the TOE framework. Based on data collected from 629 Chinese firms, we find that Support Vector Machine stands out among all machine learning algorithms: the complete model including both supply chain and TOE factors reaches an accuracy rate of 89.3 %, while the model including only TOE factors has an accuracy rate of 83 %. Based on a 10-fold cross-validated paired t-test, we further confirm that incorporating supply chain factors can significantly improve the prediction accuracy by 6.34 % over the benchmark model. Our results indicate that TOE factors are insufficient to understand and predict BT adoption; supply chain factors also need to be considered.}

This paper aims to present a comprehensive review of the nature and complexity of the evolution of water utilities, including the existing methodologies to model the changes and the knowledge gaps that must be addressed. This research found that technological, social, environmental, economic, regulatory and operational factors influence water utilities. New challenges are emerging around using legacy IT systems, aging infrastructure, environmental impact and sustainability, data management, data analytics and cybersecurity knowledge and skills, customer and community engagement, government reporting requirements and regulatory compliance. Water utilities are continuing to respond to influencing factors and address emerging challenges, and as a result, system interconnections are increasing, resulting in complexity and uncertainty. Methodological gaps exist in representing water utilities from a broader lens as a CPHS to identify and evaluate multiple influencing factors, their interconnections and impacts and evolving risks for supporting decision-making. Gaps also exist in strategic planning for technology adoption and data management. Future research requires a focus on identifying and mapping increasing system interconnections, modelling their emergent behaviour and understanding the implications of water utilities evolving as CPHSs.}

Additionally, we provide a heuristic for determining the optimal governance choice via the interplay of transactivity (i.e.,the contributors, connections, and consistency in an exchange network) and corresponding governance costs. Our study advances the governance literature by defining digital governance as a distinct form and outlining key governance mechanisms and choices in the digital era.

It may be appropriate for governments to provide more direct support: in essence, deresponsibilizing citizens who struggle to embrace the responsibility. In this paper, we explore whether US citizens would be willing to accept more help from their government in the cyber realm. Using two studies, we find that perceptions related to the government's competence and benevolence are necessary pre-requisites for a willingness to be deresponsibilized, and also that many respondents did not have confidence that either of these were sufficient. This deficiency might well render governments’ well-intended deresponsibilization endeavours futile. We conclude by proposing deresponsibilization strategies that acknowledge and accommodate this.}

By exploiting the Individual datasets of different hospitals in FL setting could be used to develop reliable screening, diagnosis, and treatment predictive models to tackle major challenges such as pandemics. FL can enable the development of very diverse medical imaging datasets and thus provide more reliable models for all participating nodes, including those with low quality data. However, the issue with the traditional Federated Learning paradigm is the degradation of generalization power due to poorly trained local models at the client nodes. The generalization power of the FL paradigm can be improved by considering the relative learning contribution of client nodes. Simple aggregation of learning parameters in the standard FL model faces a diversity issue and results in more validation loss during the learning process. This issue can be resolved by considering the relative contribution of each client node participating in the learning process. The class imbalance at each site is another significant challenge that greatly impacts the performance of the aggregated learning model. This work considers Context Aggregator FL based on the context of loss-factor and class-imbalance issues by incorporating the relative contribution of the collaborating nodes in FL by proposing Validation-Loss based Context Aggregator (CAVL) and Class Imbalance based Context Aggregator (CACI). The proposed Context Aggregator is evaluated on several different Covid-19 imaging classification datasets present on participating nodes. The evaluation results show that Context Aggregator performs better than standard Federating average Learning algorithms and FedProx Algorithm for Covid-19 image classification problems.}

abstract = {The design of the lattice coupling mode in current spatiotemporal chaotic systems lacks dynamic characteristics. When it is applied to the cryptosystem, its chaotic performance defects weaken the security of the cryptosystem. In this context, it is urgent to design new coupling rules and secure cryptosystems based on fractal and chaos theory. In this paper, a kind of sorting vector based on the fractal sorting matrix and fractal curve, the Hilbert sorting vector (HSV), is proposed creatively, and its iterative generation process is introduced. HSV is irregular and infinitely iterable. According to the requirements of the actual situation, HSV has a flexible adjustment vector length, which improves the multiplicity and efficiency of changing information positions. Then, HSV is used to reconstitute the the interaction of nodes during iteration in a new spatiotemporal chaotic system named Hilbert-sorting-vector coupled map lattice (HSVCML). Using this new sorting vector, the dynamic characteristics of spatiotemporal chaotic systems can be effectively improved. This is proved by comparing their Lyapunov exponent, Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, bifurcation diagram, and information entropy with the coupled map lattice (CML). Moreover, the rich spatio-temporal behaviours of HSVCML are studied. Therefore, HSVCML is more appropriate for image encryption than CML. Finally, HSV is combined with a spatiotemporal chaotic system to frame an image encryption method. For the purpose of proving the effectiveness and security of this algorithm against different types of attacks, a large number of tests related to security analysis and time complexity analysis are carried out. Simulation results prove that our encryption algorithm is more secure and efficient than the previous algorithms and can resist various attacks.}

This paradigm allows customers and production service providers to meet on a virtual platform, and from there, to generate business opportunities. In turn, different production service providers can associate with each other, in such a way that each one can enhance the level of service they offer or even take advantage of their idle capacity by offering it to other providers. These advantages have increased the interest in Cloud Manufacturing, yielding a wide number of architectures and systems that enable these interactions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study about these architectures, as well as a review of the current literature on the subject. For this, a systematic review of the literature is reported. Based on an in-depth review of the selected works, we were able to identify the main contributions of the current state of the literature about Cloud Manufacturing architectures. Four lines of research were identified that should be strengthened and expanded in the future to continue with the development of this paradigm. These lines are: (i) digital twins developments, (ii) scheduling and logistics, (iii) services composition and resources sharing and (iv) interoperability. Finally, it is presented an open-source project for Cloud Manufacturing architectures and their implementation, which emerge from the literature review as a promising tool to leverage Cloud Manufacturing technologies.}

Following a broad review of relevant literature, primary data were collected from students in Myanmar about their use of IT for online learning and the outcomes. The raw data resulting from this field research has been shared with stakeholders who analyzed, evaluated, and commented on it during expert interviews. The main findings are: IT usage for online education among students in Myanmar is a matter of major concern. A majority of students nationwide have no access to computers. The IT skill level in the country corresponds to this finding and is only on an average level. Smartphones are more accessible but are often old or of lower quality. Internet connections are available but are vulnerable to disruptions initiated by the military regime. Therefore, it can be concluded that students in Myanmar in many cases did not have the technical equipment or skills necessary to learn effectively through the usage of IT during the national crises. Nevertheless, it can be stated that IT helped and was also supportive in sustaining and improving the well-being of students in Myanmar.}

Innovative agricultural advancements has undoubtedly supported the expansion of the capacity and efficiency of different agricultural activities. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization assessment, the world’s population is expected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, and 9.6 billion by 2050 which will result in an unprecedented demand for food and agriculture products. It is estimated that the food production should increase by 70 percent to meet such a demand. Given the limited farming space, lack of water, climate change, and constantly changing environmental conditions, new and innovative smart agriculture solutions must be developed. In general, there has been an increase in the agricultural production volume over the time to ensure the food security. Efforts are being made to increase the quality and quantity of agribusiness products by transforming them into smart and connected products through a smart agriculture industry. Smart and precision agriculture refers to the integration of technology, such as the Internet of things, sensors, robotics, artificial intelligence, smart supply chains, big data analytics, and blockchain, into the agriculture industry. The Internet of things era is the umbrella that covers and enables the other technological tools. Smart technology integration can lead to a more productive and efficient agriculture via reducing the need for manual human interactions and making proactive intelligent decisions.

A variety of I4.0 based innovations with several sustainability implications exists in the literature, but they largely address independent and distinct knowledge areas, which yields an opportunity to explore the interconnections of I4.0-innovation-sustainability nexus. Therefore, this research performs a systematic literature review to synthesize the nexus by investigating how a combination of I4.0 technologies and different types of innovations, could contribute to sustainable development thereby providing sustainability implications. Our review portfolio derived from three databases analyzed 58 journal articles that addressed the simultaneous links of I4.0-innovation-sustainability. The primary findings show that I4.0 results in various innovation types including process, product, business model, supply chain, organizational, open, and marketing innovations that advance triple bottom line (TBL) sustainability, circular economy (CE), sustainable business models (SBMs) and achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). While most studies focus on process, product, and business model innovations with TBL and CE implications, more research is required to address the significant but overlooked areas such as open, organizational, and marketing innovations to advance business model sustainability and SDGs.}

This study explores container shipping service providers’ (CSSPs) current adoption status and perceived barriers in integrating blockchain applications before providing adoption recommendations. A qualitative analysis was conducted on thirty-two interviews with experts holding managing positions from container terminal operators, shipping companies, and freight forwarders. Thematic analysis was employed to extract and aggregate information from the qualitative database. This study revealed the difference between CSSPs’ perceptions of blockchain adoption barriers and, accordingly, their adopting approaches. A challenging implementing process for the current blockchain applications in container shipping was depicted with ten barriers and twenty-nine connections. Industry experts provided six recommendations for successful blockchain adoption to address the complicated situation. This paper deepens the knowledge about blockchain in supply chains, especially maritime logistics operations. It sheds light on the complexity of perceived adoption barriers, their effect on CSSPs’ approaches to blockchain applications, and potential digitalization policies to be taken.}

Understanding the implications of IA for sustainability is critical since leveraging these technologies shapes operations and policies that can promote sustainable digitalization and automation practices. We study how firms' technological, organizational, environmental, and human resource contexts impact IA implementation. The study further explains how IA may associate with the firm's triple bottom line while accounting for the moderating role of corporate social responsibility strategy. The study surveyed 207 multinational firms in 2022 and used partial least square-structural equation modeling to test the hypothesized relationships. Results showed that IA implementation is mainly determined by the characteristics of the firm's internal environment, such as absorptive capacity, employee socio-behavioral concerns, and social capital competency. IA may offer valuable opportunities for boosting the firm's economic and environmental sustainability performance. Nonetheless, IA is a double-edged sword for social sustainability, harming social values in implementing firms with informal corporate social sustainability strategies. Conversely, firms with formal corporate social sustainability strategy have a significantly higher opportunity to transform the value of IA into social sustainability performance. Findings are expected to assist managers and decision-makers with streamlining an impartial and sustainable transition of organizations toward automation.}

Some intelligent methods to foresee stability are required to mitigate unintended instability in a smart grid design. This is due to the rise in domestic and commercial constructions and the incorporation of green energy into smart grids. It is currently hard to forecast the stability of the smart grid. In this framework, a smart grid with reliable mechanisms is being implemented to meet the fluctuating energy demands as well as providing more availability. The involvement of consumers and producers is one of the many factors influencing the grid's stability.This study suggested anovelapproach for locating stability statistics in smart grid systems utilizing machine learning frameworks was presented. This paper outlined the multi-layer perceptron-Extreme Learning Machine (MLP-ELM)methodology to predict the sustainability of the smart grid. Additionally, this utilized the principal component analysis (PCA) approach for extracting features. In addition to an empirical assessment and a comparison to various approaches, this article presents an implementation result for smart grid stability. Simulation findings demonstrate that the suggested MLP-ELM approach outperforms traditional machine learning techniques, with accuracy reaching up to 95.8%, precision at 90%, recall at 88%, and F-measure at 89%.}

By analyzing 1021 articles published in 416 journals spanning the period from 2015 to 2022, this study aims at revealing Airbnb research topics and trends. The results show that the primary focus of academic inquiry regarding Airbnb revolves around two domains: the company's operational practices and its impacts on various domains. Within the realm of Airbnb's operational practices, four distinct research topics emerge as particularly prominent and extensively explored. These encompass the dynamics of ‘trust in Airbnb,’ the formulation and implementation of ‘house rules,’ the mechanisms of governing ‘Airbnb pricing’ strategies, and the critical examination of ‘value creation in Airbnb’ initiatives. Meanwhile, the most researched impacts of Airbnb are on urban tourism, rental housing markets, tourist destinations, and hotels. These spheres have received significant scholarly attention due to the profound implications and transformative effects engendered by Airbnb's disruptive presence in these areas. Moreover, the findings underscore that research pertaining to Airbnb's operational aspects has witnessed a significant increase in popularity over time, indicating a marked shift in the focal points of Airbnb research. Notably, the research topics that have experienced substantial growth include ‘trust in Airbnb,’ ‘Airbnb pricing,’ and ‘impacts on tourist destinations.’ Lastly, this study found that Airbnb-related research articles in hospitality and tourism journals tend to be more delving into industry-specific phenomena and challenges. Conversely, non-hospitality and tourism journals provide a broader coverage of topics related to Airbnb, encapsulating diverse areas of inquiry beyond the boundaries of the industry. This literature review provides valuable insights into existing research on Airbnb and highlights several critical areas for future research.}

Findings in Study-1 revealed that powerful buyers and supply chain absorptive capacity contribute to visibility to create cyber-resilience, while dominant suppliers are reluctant to share information in visibility practice. In a scenario-based experiment on supply chain and operations managers, we scrutinized the role of visibility by manipulating timeliness and accuracy in Study 2. Study 2 revealed that supply chain and operations managers believed that companies and their suppliers could avoid, maintain, and recover from disruption when real-time information is available.}

IoT is unique technology that have the potential to solve numerous Food Supply Chain (FSC) challenges such as product traceability, food safety and security etc. However, adoption of the IoT in the FSC poses significant challenges, particularly in developing countries. Therefore, this study explores the barriers that hinder IoT adoption in the FSC. In order to fulfil this objective, fourteen barriers related to the adoption of IoT in the FSC are identified through the literature review. These barriers are analysed with the fuzzy Delphi method in consultation with the expert team. Through the fuzzy Delphi method, twelve significant barriers have been finalised that need to be overcome for the development of an IoT-enabled FSC. These barriers include the complex framework, IoT affordability, poor IT infrastructure, legal and regulatory standards, low awareness about IoT benefits, lack of skilled personnel, trust management, absence of knowledge management system, data heterogeneity, high investment and maintenance cost and IoT supplier scarcity. The findings of this study are helpful for FSC managers to make their supply chain digitalised by overcoming these barriers. Further, the policy planner could analyse their food supply chain in the context of the identified barriers to understand their cause so that they could better prepare themselves to adopt IoT.}

Enabling I4.0 technologies, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and additive manufacturing, can be implemented through various combinations to achieve different impacts on a company's performance. But what are the possible ways of combining I4.0 technologies into bundles, and do these ways actually help to achieve a performance that outperforms the adoption of single technologies? This study aims to identify the potential patterns of the technological complementary of I4.0 by considering enabled applications and performance outcomes. We interviewed 13 Italian experts in the I4.0 field, and then combined the obtained information with secondary data collected from more than 150 I4.0 use cases, as well as from websites, reports and press releases. By adopting a systems theory lens, the results of the analysis have allowed us to identify the specific performance effects of both scattered and joint technological adoptions in different application areas. Interestingly, specific examples of I4.0 complementarities emerged, namely full, hybrid and platform complementarity. This study contributes to the growing research on I4.0 outcomes by extending the concept of technological complementary within the I4.0 context. Results show that bundles of technologies have a broader effect on performance than when the same technologies are adopted in isolation, but also that single technologies can impact specific applications and the overall performance of a firm via a systematic I4.0 transformation path.}

One of the proposed optimisation initiatives is the digitalization of nuclear facility control and instrumentation. Digitalization of nuclear control and instrumentation will improve plants' performance and cost competitiveness. However, it could also introduce cyber security challenges. To create a strong cyber-defence for critical digital assets in nuclear facilities, an extensive analysis of threats and vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and devices is necessary. This article examines recent research that analyses the digital assets at nuclear power facilities for threats and vulnerabilities. This work synthesizes and categorises potential attack propagation paths in digitalized nuclear facilities based on five different surfaces: direct network path, programmable logic controllers, sensor/actuator signals, and indirect propagation paths such as attacks that exploit human factors and the supply chain. The work's main contribution is it provides a state-of-the-art understanding of the relationship between attack propagation paths, associated vulnerabilities, and current security controls. Based on the literature review, a framework for developing an attack-resilient control system for NPPs is suggested, which would be helpful for a security-informed design of reactor control systems. The discussion on nuclear cyber risks, vulnerabilities, attack routes, and defence methods offers a cutting-edge understanding of the security challenges in digitalized nuclear facilities. The suggested framework is an essential foundation for future research direction, towards a secured and resilient digitisation of nuclear power plant control systems.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrated with Blockchain distributed ledger technology (BDLT) has become the most attractive research area in the domain of renewable energy and related power automations. However, the increased use of renewable energy-enabled devices raised various challenging problems, such as smart grid-based control management, power distribution, and automations. In this manner, the collaborative approach of blockchain, AI, and wireless sensor networks (WSN) provides a secure platform for control centers to estimate state, which helps to detect and analysis of bad data movement. There are various emerging issues in the field of Blockchain-AI in a renewable environment that poses a serious impact on the technological evaluation, for example, monitoring of contingency, optimal power flow, network reconfiguration, and the commitment of security-constrained units, and control auto-generation. So, in this paper, we perform a systematic review of the state-of-the-art integrated artificial intelligence and blockchain-enabled scheduling, management, optimization, privacy, and security of the smart grid and power distribution automation. One of the focusing aspects of this research is the real-time analysis of the physical layer of the smart grid. However, in this paper, we design a framework of a unified and abstracted state-space, in which the system analysis involves malicious attacks and maintain an effective generalized defense hierarchy in real-time. The current mechanism of analysis of smart grid-enabled physical layer-based malicious attacks is categorized into their associative and targeted components. Thus, we present three different pseudo-smart contracts and digital signatures with consensus policies; that provide an understanding of the new registry of renewable smart grids details, participating stakeholders and their roles, and an updated power distribution automation ledger. We then highlighted the list of emerging power distribution automation-related limitations along with the informational management approaches that present the existing state-of-the-art in this domain, including data-driven, target defense, computation, preservation, etc. Finally, we discuss open research issues and future directions of the smart grid and automation of power distribution security and privacy.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a complex and diverse network consisting of resource-constrained sensors/devices/things that are vulnerable to various security threats, particularly Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks. Recently, the integration of Software Defined Networking (SDN) with IoT has emerged as a promising approach for improving security and access control mechanisms. However, DDoS attacks continue to pose a significant threat to IoT networks, as they can be executed through botnet or zombie attacks. Machine learning-based security frameworks offer a viable solution to scrutinize the behavior of IoT devices and compile a profile that enables the decision-making process to maintain the integrity of the IoT environment. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach to detect DDoS attacks in an SDN-WISE IoT controller. We have integrated a machine learning-based detection module into the controller and set up a testbed environment to simulate DDoS attack traffic generation. The traffic is captured by a logging mechanism added to the SDN-WISE controller, which writes network logs into a log file that is pre-processed and converted into a dataset. The machine learning DDoS detection module, integrated into the SDN-WISE controller, uses Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to classify SDN-IoT network packets. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework using different traffic simulation scenarios and compare the results generated by the machine learning DDoS detection module. The proposed framework achieved an accuracy rate of 97.4%, 96.1%, and 98.1% for NB, SVM, and DT, respectively. The attack detection module takes up to 30% usage of memory and CPU, and it saves about 70% memory while keeping the CPU free up to 70% to process the SD-IoT network traffic with an average throughput of 48 packets per second, achieving an accuracy of 97.2%. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in detecting DDoS attacks in an SDN-WISE IoT environment. The proposed approach can be used to enhance the security of IoT networks and mitigate the risk of DDoS attacks.}

Previous studies have revealed that although high-tech new ventures possess cutting-edge technology, they face significant challenges because of vital resource constraints and limited management capability. Design thinking practices have emerged as a prominent problem-solving approach offering innovation benefits during high uncertainties. However, in the context of high-tech ventures, more research is needed on linking the relationship between design thinking principles, innovation theories (effectuation and causation), and firm performance. The present study investigates how the design thinking principles influence innovation theories and whether it leads to improved high-tech venture performance. Based on a survey of 291 platform-based start-ups in India, the results show that design thinking ways are well integrated into the theories of effectuation and causation, facilitating the growth of platform-based ventures. However, the influence of effectuation and causation on platform-based venture performance is found to be mediated through the digital capabilities acquired by these ventures.}

This work studies the relationship between hospitality workers' awareness and training about the risks of cybercrime on one hand, and the number of cyberattacks suffered by firms on the other. Using representative data for EU-27 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in 2021, we show that hospitality firms whose workers are not properly aware of cyber risks are victim of more security breaches. However, current formal training practices are not being successful at decreasing the attacks suffered. Moreover, cybercrimes are positively associated with the use of personal devices and firms’ degree of digitalization. Our findings have important implications for hospitality management, suggesting that (i) better ICT training is needed to decrease the likelihood of suffering cyberattacks, and (ii) the use of personal devices at work is a commonly neglected risk factor.}

The positive relationship between internet use and trade is present for international and domestic trade, goods and services, high- and low-income exporters, and at the intensive and extensive margin. We also find that digital trade facilitation provisions in trade agreements have significantly increased trade for high-income exporters, especially for services trade. Informed by these findings, we use a general equilibrium model of trade to assess the trade and welfare impacts of increased internet connectivity and digital trade policies for developing countries. Increasing internet connectivity can have large positive welfare impacts on poorly connected countries, but these results also highlight the dangers of developing countries falling behind if they are not able to improve internet infrastructure. Introducing digital trade provisions into an existing trade agreement between high- and low-income countries can facilitate growth in trade in services for both members.}

Through empirical research based on a questionnaire structured on four categories of influencing factors, we investigated professional accountants' perceptions of their readiness for further training in light of new labor market trends. Our analysis reveals that readiness for further training and adherence to the accounting profession in the context of digitization are influenced by several factors. First, it is influenced by respondents' perceptions of the ease of using digital tools, the level of performance achieved, expected effort and situational factors such as organizational culture and regulatory policies. Second, concerns about the acceleration of digitalization, perceived threats associated with potential job losses from the replacement of humans by artificial intelligence as well as accidental exposure of data due to the loss of control and therefore causing errors in measurement and reporting.}

Although many SLES projects have been recently deployed, only a few of them have managed to be successful, mostly due to an initial knowledge gap in the SLES planning and deployment phases. This paper leverages the knowledge from the UK’s largest SLES demonstrator in the Orkney Islands, named the Responsive FLEXibility (ReFLEX) project, to propose a framework that will help communities to successfully implement a SLES. First, this paper describes how the multi-services electrical SLES implemented in Orkney reduces the impact of the energy transition on the electrical infrastructure. We identify and discuss the main enablers and barriers to a successful SLES, based on a review of SLES projects in the UK. Second, to help future communities to implement SLES, we extend the Smart Grid Architecture Model (SGAM) into a comprehensive multi-vector Smart Local Energy Architecture Model (SLEAM) that includes all main energy services, namely power, heat and transport. This extended architecture model describes the main components and interaction layers that need to be addressed in a comprehensive SLES. Next, to inform successful deployment of SLES, an extensive list of key performance indicators for SLES is proposed and implemented for the ReFLEX project. Finally, we discuss lessons learnt from the ReFLEX project and we list required future technologies that enable communities, energy policy makers and regulatory bodies to best prepare for the energy transition.}

However, a better understanding of the issues and constituencies to receive government support to date may help digital equity activists more strategically lobby for new digital divide policies in the future. To do this, we take a macro-level approach to Van Dijk's resources and appropriation theory and examine how the framing of all digital divide–related U.S. Congressional legislation introduced between 1990 and 2020 may be associated with a bill's passage or the political party of its sponsor. Content analysis revealed that bills highlighting privacy literacy programs, educational outcomes, and corporate transparency were more likely to be passed into legislation. Bills sponsored by Republicans were 422% more likely of being passed into legislation. Certain frames were also associated with partisan sponsorship: Republican-sponsored bills were more often framed around deregulation, privacy programs, corporate transparency, and rural access, whereas Democrat-sponsored bills were more often framed around digital skills such as digital literacy and educational outcomes. Findings serve as a historical record of digital equity priorities in the U.S. and highlight possible strategies for future policy design.}

However, cyberattack detection in smart grids now faces new challenges, including privacy preservation and decentralized power zones with strategic data owners. To address these technical bottlenecks, this paper proposes a novel Federated Learning-based privacy-preserving and communication-efficient attack detection framework, known as FedDiSC, that enables Discrimination between power System disturbances and Cyberattacks. Specifically, we first propose a Federated Learning approach to enable Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition subsystems of decentralized power grid zones to collaboratively train an attack detection model without sharing sensitive power related data. Secondly, we put forward a representation learning-based Deep Auto-Encoder network to accurately detect power system and cybersecurity anomalies. Lastly, to adapt our proposed framework to the timeliness of real-world cyberattack detection in SGs, we leverage the use of a gradient privacy-preserving quantization scheme known as DP-SIGNSGD to improve its communication efficiency. Extensive simulations of the proposed framework on publicly available Industrial Control Systems datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve superior detection accuracy while preserving the privacy of sensitive power grid related information. Furthermore, we find that the gradient quantization scheme utilized improves communication efficiency by 40% when compared to a traditional federated learning approach without gradient quantization which suggests suitability in a real-world scenario.}

The potential of this convergence to fortify security, enhance privacy, and streamline operations has ignited considerable academic interest, resulting in an impressive body of literature. However, there is a noticeable scarcity of studies employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to dissect and categorize this field. This review paper endeavours to bridge this gap by meticulously analysing a dataset of 4455 journal articles drawn solely from the Scopus database, cantered around IoT and blockchain applications. Utilizing LDA, we have extracted 14 distinct topics from the collection, offering a broad view of the research themes in this interdisciplinary domain. Our exploration underscores an upswing in research pertaining to IoT and blockchain, emphasizing the rising prominence of this technological amalgamation. Among the most recurrent themes are IoT and blockchain integration in supply chain management and blockchain in healthcare data management and security, indicating the significant potential of this convergence to transform supply chains and secure healthcare data. Meanwhile, the less frequently discussed topics include access control and management in blockchain-based IoT systems and energy efficiency in wireless sensor networks using blockchain and IoT. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to apply LDA in the context of IoT and blockchain research, providing unique perspectives on the existing literature. Moreover, our findings pave the way for proposed future research directions, stimulating further investigation into the less explored aspects and sustaining the growth of this dynamic field.}

We discuss the methodology's design, specifically with respect to system development scenarios, and detail industrial case studies demonstrating the applicability of the methodology.}

abstract = {In the Oil and Gas industry, minor accidents can negatively affect people, the environment, and the enterprise on a grand scale. For this type of business, it is crucial to have adequate monitoring and maintenance operational routines. The concept of digital twins has been widely discussed as an industrial solution capable of monitoring objects in real-time, predicting their state, integrity, and safety conditions, and providing user feedback. This analysis can also perform predictive maintenance and estimate efficiency levels. This paper follows a systematic approach and inspects the current state of digital twin adoption by the Oil and Gas industry, along with cloud and edge utilization in both scenarios. The survey was conducted by filtering and selecting articles published in three different queries regarding digital twins in the Oil and Gas industry, cloud and edge usage in digital twins, and cloud and edge usage in the Oil and Gas industry. The selected articles were classified and reviewed to present an overview of the current literature regarding digital twins in the oil and gas industry and evaluate cloud-based solutions for digital twins in this context. This review found that cloud and edge adoption in the Oil and Gas industry was late compared to other industries, mainly because of security and data privacy concerns. Digital twin adoption across all industries is still in its infancy, as most of the current works are theoretical or present partial implementations, which often follow different digital twin definitions. Cloud and edge computing grant access to increased storage and computational capabilities and decouple the necessity of relying on a robust local IT infrastructure, being critical enabling factors for digital twin implementation.}

Further, our framework suggests that the need for data, technology, and talents will lead to more open and collaborative innovation approaches, novel strategies for innovation protection, and the emergence of new roles in innovation teams. Using AI for innovation management also creates challenges like ethical data usage, navigation through diversity emerging from humans collaborating with artificial intelligence, and escaping from the incremental innovation trap.

A balanced panel representing 148 BRI partner countries, comprising 78 members from high- and upper-middle income developed countries and 72 members from low- and lower-middle income developing countries, with reference to the 2013–2021 period, was used for this study. This study employed a two-step system generalised method of moments (GMM) model, which was validated through the two-stage least squares (2SLS) method. The findings indicate that FinTech, globalization, and environmental taxes contributed significantly and positively to the energy transition in the entire BRI sample. However, inflation and COVID-19 had a significant negative impact on the energy transition, whereas urbanisation negatively and insignificantly impacted the energy transition. In developed countries, all variables except urbanisation, inflation, and COVID-19 had a significantly positive effect upon the energy transition. On the other hand, in developing countries, while FinTech, environmental taxes, and high-level governance had a significant positive impact, other factors negatively impacted the energy transition. Additionally, this study suggested a balanced policy implication and future work areas that would be helpful to policymakers, governments, and academia for boosting and exploring energy transition and related aspects.}

Acknowledging the impact, existing scholarship has delved into different dimensions of this technology and outcomes of its adoption, yet when compared with the scale of industrial activity globally and the varied possibilities associated with the adoption of this relatively new technology, the literature is woefully lean. Discussions and conversations on facilitators and inhibitors of adoption and continued usage are still nascent, particularly when one ponders upon specific insights related to sectors and firm size. The present study seeks to address this paucity by using the lens of firm size. Specifically, the study examines how firm size impacts various positive and negative outcomes of industry 4.0 innovation adoption and usage using 3D printing as an exemplar. Toward this end, we conducted a qualitative study to collect responses from 46 managers, 23 each from large-size and small-size enterprises operating in the United Kingdom. Thematic coding of responses revealed five aggregate dimensions representing facilitators and four aggregate dimensions representing inhibitors. Analysis of the findings revealed differences in outcomes with firm size, indicating that the adoption and optimal use of innovations such as 3D printing were indeed incumbent on firm size in the case of disruptive, technology-driven innovations that are generically presumed to have positive outcomes. Overall, the findings of this study provide new insights into various facilitators and inhibitors of the adoption of 3D printing technology, which can help firms to make better strategic decisions on the effective usage of this technology.}

This work aims to shed light on the users' salient perceptions of the format, detect the positive elements mentioned by the surveyed participants and identify the negative items in a bid to minimize, or even revert, their effects for future editions of the master. As expected, the findings suggest that one of the main advantages of this format is that it allows students who have difficulty attending classes on campus to enroll on courses. However, the participants detected diverse elements that could be improved such as interaction, the degree of socialization, or the technical problems that arose during teaching sessions. It is hoped that these findings will be of use when adjusting new editions of the program and will help to determine the design and implementation of other hybrid virtual programs in the Institution.}

Improvements in food quality, cold chain transit, and preservation are required for safe livestock products. Though, the food safety and regulation authorities demand complete food traceability from farm to fork, but in traditional supply chain it is ignored by fiddling with the transit paperwork and bill invoices. The process of supply chain reformation and activities linked to food recalls during food safety issues are insanely expensive and challenging. Traceability-driven food supply chain management is likely to implement novel technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT). The capability of the Blockchain era within the food sector is emerging with use cases across different regions, as shown via the growing number of studies. Credibility, efficiency, and safety are all improved when food products can be instantly traced from their point of origin through all points of contact on their way to the consumer. Blockchain assures a tamper-proof and transparent system that allows an innovative business solution, together with smart contracts. However, there are significant difficulties with the implementation of blockchain technology for food traceability. It necessitates more and more training platforms as well as trainers, who can make understanding and operability of this technology easy among ground-level participants and food entities. For the tactical application of this technology, it is essential to comprehend the legal and regulatory framework.}

There is, thus, a pressing economic and social challenge of how to improve cyber security in small businesses. We look at the potential role of IT companies as a conduit through which to cascade information on best practice, focusing on the United Kingdom. We first present an analysis of the UK’s Cyber Security Breaches Survey (2018–2021) distinguishing different channels through which micro and small businesses access information on cyber security. We find that the main channel, by far, is through IT companies. Very few businesses directly access information from the government or law enforcement. To further explore the role of IT companies we conducted a series of focus groups and interviews with experts in IT and cyber security for small businesses in the UK. One theme to emerge is that IT companies, while they can be part of the solution, can also be part of the problem and so a number of interventions are needed if IT companies are to effectively disseminate best practice. These include advice and guidance for micro and small businesses on how to distinguish ‘good’ IT companies, as well as appropriate support for IT companies, who themselves are typically micro and small businesses that lack expertise on cyber security.}

The prevalence of cyberstalking, with its substantial harm to victims, highlights the importance of identifying the factors contributing to its occurrence. This study assesses, through an advanced three-level meta-analytic approach, the relative predictive validity of sociodemographic, background, risk, and protective domains of predictors associated with cyberstalking perpetration and victimization.
Methods
In each domain, multiple subdomains were measured for dozens of individual contributing factors. An extensive systematic search yielded 57 eligible studies, describing 54 independent samples between 2002 and 2022 with 515 effect sizes.
Results
Multilevel meta-analysis results revealed that the background domain had the largest composite effect sizes for both cyberstalking perpetration and victimization, followed by the risk domain, whereas sociodemographic and protective domains had no significant effect. According to the moderator analyses, the effect sizes of background and risk domains varied depending on the age of the sample and the country of the data, highlighting the need for future synthesis studies to identify the unique contributing factors to cyberstalking in adult samples from various countries.
Conclusions
Findings from this meta-analysis provide valuable evidence for the development of primary prevention and risk assessment-management, as well as cyberstalking security and guardianship.}

It argues that we need to anticipate and collect the evidence on which to govern digital agriculture technologies before such directionalities set in. To support this anticipatory need, the paper draws on findings from a research prioritisation exercise with stakeholders in the UK. It identifies and critically analyses two interconnecting meta-themes, organisational capacity and human capacity, which emerged inductively in the analysis of selected themes and priority research questions. In doing this, the paper widens the scope of enquiry about digital agriculture, by introducing ‘capacities’ as a new theoretical lens to examine how institutional structures and processes shape the utilisation of digital data, technologies and their underlying directionalities. The paper concludes by outlining the implications of this new perspective on directionalities and capacities for digital agriculture research in the UK and internationally.}

Nevertheless, analyzing datasets with sensitive or private information may raise security and privacy concerns. To balance utility maximization and privacy preservation, Privacy Preserving Utility Mining (PPUM) has been presented. The primary objective of PPUM algorithms is to conceal the sensitive knowledge that can be found via the application of utility mining algorithms to sensitive data. However, the current PPUM literature shows a paucity of privacy preserving algorithms scalable and efficient enough to handle large and dense datasets. Based on this perspective, this paper proposes three heuristic-based algorithms, namely Selecting the Most Real item sensitive utility First (SMRF), Selecting the Least Real item sensitive utility First (SLRF), and Selecting the most Desirable Item First (SDIF), to efficiently conceal all Sensitive High utility Itemsets (SHIs) while mitigating the projected detrimental impact on the non-sensitive information. The proposed algorithms rely on a novel concept, called Real Item Sensitive Utility (RISU), to effectively select a definite victim item for each SHI during the whole sanitization process. Furthermore, a new sensitive dataset sorting technique is proposed to reduce the time needed to find suitable transactions for sanitization. Through comprehensive experimental evaluations with state-of-the-arts, the viability of the proposed three algorithms was testified. The acquired findings clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms in terms of reducing the sanitization time and side effects.}

The building of an intelligent environment the capability of real-time collection of data, which is crucial for maximising the value of the IoT, will make this possible. A typical electric grid is made up of many power plants that use various power generating units, such as coal-based units, gas-based units, hydro units, etc. The majority of the infrastructure and wires that make up the conventional electricity grid have been in existence for a long time, it should be mentioned. They require significant investments, so providing them could take years. As a result, many grid components are outmoded and must be maintained and monitored on a regular basis to keep power flowing. A sophisticated technology is the smart grid (SG) system that makes it easier to integrate green technology and environmental considerations. The SG cyber–physical system was implemented thanks to the advancement and use of communication technologies in the conventional power system. The Internet of Things (IoT) and essential devices are both present in the complicated architecture of the SG systems. The traditional electric grids are been transformed into smart and efficient grid known as “Smart grid”. The Internet of Things’ smart grid allows for two-way communications among connected devices and technology that can recognise and respond to human needs. The cost and reliability of a smart grid are superior to that of conventional power infrastructure. Through use and data maintenance, smart grid technology will assist in reducing energy use and costs. One of the primary contributions made to grids is the integration of IoT with producing facilities using sustainable energy at various levels. To enhance the smart grid for bidirectional information exchange, improve power quality, and increase reliability Internet of Things (IOT) devices are becoming an important part of smart electric grid. IOT Infrastructure (IOTI) provide a flexible, efficient and secure platform providing strategic management for monitoring and controlling of different operations under different working conditions. This paper discusses cyber security on IOT based infrastructure for electric power systems. A comprehensive study is highlighted which includes type of IOTs, architecture used for smart grid, and future challenges.}

abstract = {In recent years, low-carbon transportation has become an indispensable part as sustainable development strategies of various countries, and plays a very important responsibility in promoting low-carbon cities. However, the security of low-carbon transportation has been threatened from various ways. For example, denial of service attacks pose a great threat to the electric vehicles and vehicle-to-grid networks. To minimize these threats, several methods have been proposed to defense against them. Yet, these methods are only for certain types of scenarios or attacks. Therefore, this review addresses security aspect from holistic view, provides the overview, challenges and future directions of cyber security technologies in low-carbon transportation. Firstly, based on the concept and importance of low-carbon transportation, this review positions the low-carbon transportation services. Then, with the perspective of network architecture and communication mode, this review classifies its typical attack risks. The corresponding defense technologies and relevant security suggestions are further reviewed from perspective of data security, network management security and network application security. Finally, in view of the long term development of low-carbon transportation, future research directions have been concerned.}

While many aspects of smart cities have been explored, there has been a disproportionate focus on physical and technological elements at the expense of social justice and democratic values. Although there have been attempts to advance the ideas of human-centric or people-centric approaches, a comprehensive perspective encompassing social rights, democratic values, and social justice is still missing. To fill this gap, this study introduces the concept of 'societal smart city', discusses its dimensions, and clarifies aspects of social justice as one of the main dimensions of a societal smart city. In addition to theoretical elaborations, we offer a case study of Tehran, the capital city of Iran, which has recently invested significantly in its technological infrastructure. For this purpose, we conducted a questionnaire survey. Results of the Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) indicate that four key factors, namely citizen-centric governance (α: 0.92, loading 15 variables), inclusive services (α: 0.91, loading 11 variables), resilient infrastructure (α: 0.9, loading 8 variables), and information literacy (α: 0.91, loading 6 variables) are the main underlying factors of social justice in Tehran. The study highlights the importance of social justice as a major dimension of the societal smart city and provides new insights for urban planners and policymakers on how to realize a societal smart city that offers benefits beyond physical and technological advances.}

The rise of digital communities in social media has changed the way people interact with each other, form communities, and participate in social activities. However, these interactions can also lead to conflicts, and the dissemination of harmful content can pose a risk to users' information security. This research proposes a method to mitigate these issues and optimize efficacy while minimizing potential hazards. The proposed method is based on the analysis of the information situation in the management of digital communities under conditions of complete uncertainty, antagonistic behaviour, and partial uncertainty. The study examines the decision-making process involved in antagonistic interaction among users of digital social channels. The methods proposed in this research were implemented to prevent the adverse consequences of community conflicts and the dissemination of potential risks to the security of users' information through prompt and efficacious decision-making. The proposed strategy optimizes efficacy through the implementation of the Wald criteria while minimizing potential hazards by adhering to the Savage criteria. Additionally, the Hurwitz criteria, which presents a balanced approach incorporating both the maximum and minimum criteria, was also employed. The methods were tested within the online community present on the social media platform, Facebook social networks, and the results demonstrate that the suggested technique improves the effectiveness and validity of managers' decisions in digital communities. The study also highlights the use of social networks and the virtual sphere as tools for hybrid warfare on the internet, which can be effective. Effective community management is necessary to mitigate the negative effects of online interactions, and the proposed method offers a valuable tool for managers to make informed decisions and prevent adverse consequences.}

Despite this attention, however, there is limited insight into the actual state of the art regarding MNEs, Industry 4.0 and the implications for sustainability. As a result, academic knowledge of how MNEs develop and employ digital technologies, and what significance this has in relation to sustainability, is fragmented along disciplinary boundaries. We therefore conduct a systemic multidisciplinary review of the literature, examining the different types of digital technologies, the geographical scope of the studies, and the sustainability dimensions covered.

Owing to advancements in the use of technologies related to Industry 4.0 pillars, such as the Internet of Things, Big Data analytics, and simulation, the potential of DTs to profoundly impact manufacturing has been recognised. However, DT implementation is challenging. In practice, manufacturing companies that consider DT implementation may encounter several challenges, which can prevent the achievement of its potential benefits and impede its successful realization. Research on this topic lacks empirical evidence and models to guide practitioners to overcome this problem. Therefore, the aim of this study was to map the key challenges related to DT implementation in manufacturing contexts and propose a set of possible countermeasures. To achieve this objective, we conducted a Delphi study involving 15 experts, both practitioners and academics. The process required three rounds. In the first round, the experts were requested to provide a personalized list of potential challenges to DT implementation. In the second round, the experts evaluated the challenges from the literature and their suggested potential challenges, providing a measure of relevance. Furthermore, experts were asked to propose possible countermeasures to these challenges. Finally, a third round achieved consensus. The study identified 18 key challenges divided into four categories and proposed a set of possible countermeasures to overcome these problems. Moreover, a relevance/agreement matrix of the key challenges was proposed to establish a relative impact.}

Russia is one of the leaders of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, having improved its standing in international ratings for quality of life, human development, sustainable development, innovation, and high technology. Russia's experience can be helpful to developing countries. We study and evaluate innovation in a digital business society amid technological turmoil competing with artificial intelligence. We focus on the digital competitiveness index, the density of robots in industry, and unemployment, thereby building a novel comprehensive dataset of the economy's systemic socioeconomic and technological development under the conditions of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. We draw attention to Russia's new business environment that exhibits valuable specifics (e.g., emerging institutions and imperfect competition as clouds in the business landscape) shaped by its current transitional character. We estimate that technological progress will ensure digitalization, the prevention of extended unemployment, and the achievement of full-scale automation. Russia's innovation policy has substantial advantages for emerging market settings. This study also shows that institutionalizing the new approach provides enduring digital economy advantages for emerging markets, including effectiveness, progressiveness, and sustainability.}

abstract = {Transportation electrification has been fueled by recent advancements in the technology and manufacturing of battery systems, but the industry yet is facing serious challenges that could be addressed using cutting-edge digital technologies. One such novel technology is based on the digital twining of battery systems. Digital twins (DTs) of batteries utilize advanced multi-layer models, artificial intelligence, advanced sensing units, Internet-of-Things technologies, and cloud computing techniques to provide a virtual live representation of the real battery system (the physical twin) to improve the performance, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, they orchestrate the operation of the entire battery value chain offering great advantages, such as improving the economy of manufacturing, re-purposing, and recycling processes. In this context, various studies have been carried out discussing the DT applications and use cases from cloud-enabled battery management systems to the digitalization of battery testing. This work provides a comprehensive review of different possible use cases, key enabling technologies, and requirements for battery DTs. The review inclusively discusses the use cases, development/integration platforms, as well as hardware and software requirements for implementation of the battery DTs, including electrical topics related to the modeling and algorithmic approaches, software architectures, and digital platforms for DT development and integration.

The literature lacks research into the risks that may arise in the procedure of developing digital capabilities that have considerable impacts on firms’ innovative growth. In addition, inadequate research has been conducted on challenges that may arise when a business is being developed in the context of the digital economy. Moreover, the advent of new risks specific to the digital economy has not been addressed in the overall system of modern economic relations. As a result, the current study aims to investigate the major areas of relevance to transforming companies into the digital economy, considering the impacts of new risks encountered during such transitions. Along this line, this paper develops a decision support model for evaluating risks in the digital economy transformation of the manufacturing industry. This approach is applied to compute the weights and the study ranks the most important risks for digital economy transformation in the manufacturing industry. In addition, the proposed method model is implemented to find industries’ priorities of different risks for the digital economy transformation of the manufacturing industry. Finally, a case study is carried out to assess the most important risk for the digital transformation of the manufacturing industry. The results show that lack of top management involvement (f7), with a weight of 0.0563, an unstable market environment in terms of the uncertainty industry, and market volatility, with a weight of 0.0542, are the most considerable risks for the digital economy transformation (DET) of the manufacturing industry. Additionally, comparison and sensitivity analyses are made to illustrate the advantage of the presented approach.}

These technologies can operate as platforms, becoming the base of technology integration in the digital transformation journey. However, the specialized literature has not yet addressed Industry 4.0 technologies from a system view by considering the types of platforms involved. Rather, most Industry 4.0 technologies are considered singular entities of digital transformation. Thus, we aim to define which and how Industry 4.0 technologies can operate as platforms. We propose four types of platforms that support Industry 4.0 features: (i) Networked Manufacturing Operations platforms; (ii) Vertical Integration platforms; (iii) End-to-End Engineering platforms; (vi) Horizontal Integration platforms. We adopt a Boundary-Spanning (BS) perspective to analyze technologies as Industry 4.0 platforms using four BS activities: information collection and processing, external representation; task coordination; and knowledge transformation. We employ a multiple-case approach by scrutinizing 40 cases and selecting seven in which Industry 4.0 technologies are used as platforms. Although only the internet of things and cloud-based systems are conceived as technology platforms in practice, we show that Industry 4.0 can embrace other technologies as platforms that contribute to building cyber-physical systems. We suggest that some of these technologies can operate either as stand-alone or platforms, depending on how their use is designed in the digital transformation process for Industry 4.0 implementation. We provide a framework explaining platform layering as a value chain for these technologies.}

Fuelled by adaptations to clinical trial implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic, decentralised clinical trials are burgeoning. Decentralised clinical trials involve many digital tools to facilitate research without physical contact between research teams and participants at various stages, such as recruitment, enrolment, informed consent, administering study interventions, obtaining patient-reported outcome measures, and safety monitoring. These tools can provide ways of ensuring participants' safety and research integrity, while sometimes reducing participant burden and trial cost. Research sponsors and investigators are interested in expanding the use of decentralised clinical trials. The US Food and Drug Administration and other regulators worldwide have issued guidance on how to implement such adaptations. However, there has been little focus on the distinct ethical challenges these trials pose. In this Health Policy report, which is informed by both traditional research ethics and digital ethics frameworks, we group the related ethical issues under three areas requiring increased ethical vigilance: participants' safety and rights, scientific validity, and ethics oversight. Our aim is to describe these issues, offer practical means of addressing them, and prompt the delineation of ethical standards for decentralised trials.}

This paper analyses the societal impact of AI integration in the Dutch electricity market, as part of the EU market. We found that the integration of AI by different actors could increase the electricity market's sustainability, reliability, and affordability, as the increase in accuracy and speed offers more flexibility and allows for further integration of (variable) renewable energy. The effects on the equity and equality and power balances in the electricity market are, however, uncertain. AI may unburden participants from certain tasks and allow for more active participants, but the increased complexity excludes participants with less resources and might harm the equality of opportunities in the electricity market. Moreover, the necessary digital infrastructure challenges the (cyber)security, privacy, the controllability of the technology, and autonomy of market actors. The EU and Dutch government could anticipate the above effects by supporting new market participants (e.g., energy communities and cooperatives) with an open access data base of AI programs, and by creating institutional clarity for system operators when it comes to their additional tasks, giving these actors time to prepare.}

We collected 6,871 crawl fraud cases from news reports and local websites between October 2018 and December 2021 in Mainland China and Hong Kong. We generated 2,747 messages from news and open-source message datasets on GitHub. Based on these novel datasets, we conducted a comparative analysis of cyber telecom scams between Mainland China and Hong Kong and identified victim profiles using adata technology and target group index analysis. Furthermore, we developed a message-classifier scam alert model using data mining and machine learning algorithms. Our study provides valuable insights and essential implications on how data analytics can support future antifraud initiatives and help cities build safer urban hubs.}
