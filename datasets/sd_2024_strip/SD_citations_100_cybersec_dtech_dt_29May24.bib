abstract = {Smart farming practices offer decision-making support as farmers navigate economic, social, and environmental challenges. However, smart farming adoption remains low in many farming contexts due to the perceived cost and skills required, and hesitancies about sharing agricultural data. Numerous studies have reviewed the factors that influence smart farming adoption within different agricultural scenarios, but to the best our knowledge, none have specifically reviewed the motivators and obstacles of agri-data sharing within smart farming. The objective of this research was to identify and classify the most prominent drivers and barriers for sharing agri-data across stakeholders, by examining the existing literature. A Systematic Literature Review was conducted using the PRISMA 2020 methodology. The query initially identified 491 papers from Scopus and Web of Science, and after screening the final number of papers for assessment was 59. Factors affecting the willingness and capability to engage in agricultural data sharing were categorised in socio-economic, systemic, technical, and legal categories. The most prominent drivers for agri-data sharing were systemic and technical, which were discussed in 58% and 57% of the papers, respectively. Technical factors were the most prevalent barriers, discussed in 68% of the literature. Perceived knowledge gain leading to improved decision-making, collaboration across the agri-value chain, improved technologies, and clarity around data sovereignty were key enablers identified for sharing data. Lack of knowledge about the purpose and benefit of sharing data, mistrust of “who will benefit from my data”, data privacy and security, and lack clarity on data ownership and rights of use were the prominent concerns. The findings from this paper will help inform on-the-ground social science research across the EU focused on feasible options for promoting the benefits of agri-data sharing.}

abstract = {This comprehensive meta-analysis investigates the significant factors influencing consumer decision-making in e-commerce. Predominantly focusing on the parameters of trust, perceived risk, perceived security, and electronic word-of-mouth (e-WOM), this study provides insightful revelations on their integral roles in shaping e-commerce purchasing decisions. The findings demonstrate that trust, perceived risk, perceived security, and e-WOM significantly influence consumers' e-commerce purchasing decisions. Perceived Risk plays a substantial moderating role in the relationship between Trust and e-commerce purchasing decisions, amplifying the importance of managing and minimizing risk in online transactions to cultivate consumer trust. Contrastingly, the roles of Perceived Security and e-WOM do not hold the same moderating effect on the trust-purchasing decision nexus, underscoring the direct yet unmoderated influence these factors have on e-commerce purchasing behaviors. Furthermore, The research reveals no significant size effect difference among respondents from high-income and low-income countries or between general internet users and online shoppers concerning the impact of trust on e-commerce purchasing decisions. This intriguing finding suggests the universal importance of trust in the digital purchasing landscape, irrespective of socio-economic status or the degree of e-commerce engagement. This study thus sheds new light on the complexities of e-commerce decision-making processes. It offers valuable insights for businesses aiming to enhance consumer trust and engagement in the expanding digital marketplace.}

abstract = {In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant shift in consumer behavior has accelerated the transition towards e-commerce, with a notable surge in online group buying. This research pioneers the integration of the Theory of Planned Behavior with neurophysiological measurements to dissect the complex interplay between product price, risk perception, and consumer trust in influencers on online group buying intentions amidst a global health crisis. Unlike previous studies that primarily rely on self-reported data, this investigation employs brainwave analysis to capture the immediate physiological responses of consumers to pandemic-related stimuli, thereby offering a novel perspective on the underlying psychological processes. Our findings reveal that while traditional factors such as price, quantity, and time continue to influence purchasing attitudes, the pandemic has uniquely modulated these effects, with social influence playing a pivotal role in shaping trust towards influencers and, consequently, group buying intentions. Significantly, the study uncovers that COVID-19's impact, though seemingly negligible in survey responses, exerts a profound influence when assessed through experimental measures. By bridging the gap between theoretical models and empirical neurological evidence, this study not only addresses a critical research void but also enhances our understanding of consumer decision-making in times of uncertainty. This advancement in knowledge contributes to the extant literature by providing a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of the factors affecting online group buying, offering valuable insights for both academics and practitioners navigating the evolving landscape of e-commerce during and beyond the pandemic era.}

Sustainable supply chain transparency is established to enhance the disclosure and visibility of sustainability information within and outside the supply chain. However, the complexity and uncertainty of accessing supply chain information make such assessments challenging. This study integrates the balanced scorecard as the theoretical foundation in addition to the technical perspective for a performance model, employing a hybrid of the fuzzy Delphi method, a fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory, an analytic network process and Choquet Integral. The analysis aims to identify valid sustainable supply chain transparency attributes, examine causal relationships, assess hierarchical interdependencies, and indicate priority practices for Taiwan's semiconductor industry. The findings reveal six aspects and 20 indicators as a valid hierarchical structure, with causal aspects such as stakeholder efforts, information processing and analytics, and digital capability. The crucial managerial implications that focus on production and logistics processes, government regulation, safety and data security include connectivity and data confidentiality. The prioritizing practices of disclosure, traceability, and visibility are indicated to improve sustainable supply chain transparency in the industry.}

These challenges are exacerbated by widespread disparities in access to dermatological care and the prevalence of misinformation. This paper, derived from the Skin & Digital Summit at the “International Master Course on Aging Science (IMCAS) critically evaluates how digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), tele-dermatology, and large language models (LLMs) can bridge these access gaps. It explores practical applications and case studies demonstrating the impact of these technologies in various settings, with a particular focus on adapting solutions to meet the diverse needs of LMICs. Additionally, the narrative highlights the ongoing conversation within the dermatological community about the role of digital advances in healthcare, emphasizing that this discussion is dynamic and one that is continuously evolving. Dermatologists play an essential role in this transition, integrating digital tools into mainstream care to complement a patient-centred, culturally sensitive approach. The paper advocates for a globally coordinated digital response that not only addresses current disparities in skin health care but also promotes equitable access to digital health resources, making dermatological care more representative of all skin types and accessible worldwide.}

These disparities arise due to influences that vary discreetly based on crucial factors such as the target, motive, or impact. This article draws upon the Information Technology Amendment Act (ITAA) of 2008 in India, analyses how these factors regulate online crimes, and thereby conducts a comprehensive analysis of current literature to differentiate cybercrime, cyberattacks, and cyberterrorism. The proposed framework includes a target-impact (intent) model to differentiate illicit online activities, complemented by a discussion on the actor-intent model, which emphasizes their treatment and implications within the legal context. The article explores the target-impact (intent) definition of cybercrime, highlighting its significance in capturing the cyber aspect and differentiating it from cyberattacks. Case studies are presented to illustrate these distinctions effectively. Furthermore, the article highlights variations in mitigation strategies, investigative protocols, punitive measures, and legal consequences corresponding to the identified classifications. Lastly, it incorporates insights from theoretical criminology and sociology, discusses how the proposed target-impact (intent) model aligns with the routine activity theory, and attempts to distinguish online crimes using the institutional theory.}

Government funds supporting banks and platforms in digital transformation prove more effective than direct subsidies to SMEs. Achieving sustainable development requires an optimal balance between investment and efficiency due to the impact of digitalization costs on constructing digital financial networks. The study advocates for a long-term microcredit financing mode tailored to SMEs, aiding them in maintaining financial stability. Additionally, intermediary nodes within the network, such as credit rating companies, can facilitate information sharing, thereby fostering the growth of digital financial networks. This heightened information sharing enhances the payoff for each subject and reduces financing constraints. Furthermore, the study establishes that digital financial networks can alleviate the repercussions of unforeseen events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, empirical analysis of the Beijing University Inclusive Finance Index data and financial records of Chinese SMEs listed on the New Third Board from 2016 to 2018 confirms that digital finance can alleviate the financing constraints of SMEs. In summary, the progression of digital financial networks is intricate, necessitating a thorough comprehension of diverse factors. The government is encouraged to guide the enhancement of relevant systems and regulations, bolstering supervision, and facilitating the high-quality development of digital finance networks.}

To address this issue, researchers have been looking for sustainable solutions to establish Circular Economy best practices for the full value chain of products made of glass, particularly for waste from high-quality glass sheets. Unfortunately, most of this waste is either dumped in landfills or recycled in an open-loop manner, due to its diverse composition and low volume. However, with the advent of Industry 4.0 and 5.0 technologies, including machine-to-machine communication, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, collaborative robots, dynamic life cycle assessment, and advanced remanufacturing techniques, it could now become possible to characterize and recover end-of-life high-quality glass sheets like chemically strengthened glasses, e.g. used in smartphone screens, real time in smart factories for use in other high-tech applications. Such smart factories can economically produce on-demand batch-size 1 products, marking a fundamental transition from conventional recycling methods to a sustainable solution. This paper delves into the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies in glass recycling research and the potential contributions of Industry 5.0, addressing its societal implications. It also introduces an intelligent method to assess and optimize the lifespan of smartphone screen glass, suggesting potential reuse or remanufacturing solutions.}

In this study, advances in emerging digital technologies have been systematically and comprehensively reviewed, in terms of current development status and mechanisms for energy efficiency and energy integration in energy-efficient systems. Afterwards, roles of energy digitalization technologies are provided for high-efficiency, low-carbon and intelligent building energy systems, including artificial intelligence for dynamic performance predictions, advanced model predictive controls and optimisations of nonlinear systems (e.g., PVs, heat pumps, heat recovery systems and multi-energy storages). Furthermore, digital twin-based building energy digitalization technologies are applied for 3D modeling, monitoring, real-time visualization and virtual reality interaction. Frontier multi-agent based distributed energy systems are comprehensively proposed with multi-agent energy management, including RE-battery-building-EV, RE-building-hydrogen vehicles, and both centralised and distributed energy management systems. Considering the multi-energy system capability for power management (intermittent renewable energy and energy demands) and survival capability when suffering from high-impact and low-probability events, both energy flexibility and energy resilience with energy digitalization technologies are interconnected, for climate change adaption and internet of energy.

To address this knowledge gap, we developed a conceptual model and investigated the impact of the cyber-emulated risks (cyberattack, safety risk, connectivity risk, privacy risk, and performance risk) that may influence the adoption of CAVs. We tested the proposed model using structural equation modelling with a nationally representative sample of 2062 adults from the US, UK, New Zealand, and Australia. The results indicate that perceived cyberattacks had a significant but marginally neutral effect on usage intent, illustrating the acceptance of technical risk with CAVs. This finding challenges the commonly held belief that cyberattacks negatively influence the adoption of products and technology in other product development fields, such as information technology. CAV cyberattacks elevate concerns about safety, connectivity, privacy, and performance risks. Interestingly, connectivity risk had no significant impact on CAV's behaviour intention, but mediation analysis showed it indirectly affects CAV's acceptance through privacy and performance risks. Regarding socio-demographic and technological attributes, participants of older age, middle income, low-middle education, high cybersecurity knowledge and AV understanding exhibit high anxiety about CAV cyberattacks. The results hold significant policy implications, suggesting the need for tailored strategies in enhancing the cybersecurity of CAVs to ensure their successful adoption and deployment. The findings of this study aim to enhance the quality of transport policy and bridge the gap between theory and practice in addressing cyber risks in the transport sector.}

Based on the fundamental fact of invariance of probabilistic characteristics of a cyclic random process to time shifts determined by its rhythm function, rhythm-adaptive statistical estimations of initial, central and mixed moment functions of cyclic random processes of discrete parameter were obtained. The article analytically proves the unbiasedness and consistency of rhythm-adaptive statistical estimates of the mathematical expectation and the initial moment functions of the higher order of cyclic random process. By conducting a series of computer simulation experiments, it has been demonstrated, that the absolute errors of rhythm-adaptive methods of statistical estimation are significantly smaller than the corresponding errors for classical non-rhythm adaptive methods of statistical estimation of cyclic stochastic signals probabilistic characteristics. The effectiveness of using rhythm-adaptive methods of statistical estimation of probabilistic characteristics of ECG signals has been demonstrated. The results obtained in the work clearly demonstrate the essential advantages of rhythm-adaptive methods of statistical processing of cyclic stochastic signals with a variable (irregular) rhythm in comparison with non-rhythm-adaptive analogues.}

These pillars comprise sustainability, resilience, and the utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for monitoring and managing structural health and performance. This is evident in the context of smart buildings and their ability to enhance energy consumption efficiency, improve quality of life, and strengthen structural health monitoring in terms of reducing damage and facilitating timely maintenance operations. Through comparing the components of the virtual city designed from two types of alkali-activated binder concrete (AABC) and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete, all components of the city designed from AABC showed a reduction in the amount of emitted CO2. The highest decrease was observed in the schools designed from AABC, where the reduction was about 25 %, while the lowest decrease was for the villas and infrastructure; about 11 % and 10 % respectively, compared to those designed from OPC concrete. The results also indicated that the utilization of sustainable concrete instead of traditional varieties has the potential to decrease CO2 emissions by up to 25 %. The importance of this work resides in establishing a basis for forthcoming research that combines intelligent, environmentally friendly, and resilient building practices.}

While marketing research generally indicates that these investments should pay off, recent experiences from managerial practice suggest that such beneficial payoffs may not necessarily arise. To examine the effects of implementing IDSTs on B2B firm performance, we differentiate between customer-sensing and customer-linking IDSTs: while customer-sensing IDST has the primary purpose of identifying new sales opportunities (e.g., predictive analytics) early within the B2B sales funnel, the purpose of customer-linking IDST (e.g., augmented reality application) is to close sales opportunities. The results of a multi-data study involving 314 B2B firms confirm that implementing customer-sensing and customer-linking IDST can exhibit a complementary, positive effect on firm profit, but this effect strongly varies with the sales task environment in terms of firms’ offering and demand complexity. In unfavorable conditions, extensive digitalization in B2B sales can even harm firm profit. These findings contribute to sales technology research and the literature on marketing capabilities and guide managers on how to ensure successful sales digitalization.}

Access to clean, modern, and affordable energy, also known as SDG 7, is one of the goals. Universal access to clean, modern, and affordable electricity is one of the metrics for measuring a good life as it fundamentally affects education, healthcare, food security, job creation, and other socioeconomic indices. To achieve this goal and targets, there has been increased traction in research, development, actionable plans, policies, and other activities by governments, the scientific community, environmentalists, development experts, and other stakeholders in achieving the goal. This review presents the various avenues by which AI and digitization can provide impetus to achieving SDG 7. The global trends in attaining clean electricity, clean cooking fuel, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and international public financial flows between 2005 and 2021 are reviewed while the contribution of AI and digitization towards meeting SDG 7 are highlighted. The study concludes that the deployment of AI and digitization into the energy sector will catalyze the attainment of SDG 7 by 2030, provided ethical issues, regulatory concerns, manpower shortage, and other shortcomings are effectively handled. The study recommends adequate infrastructural upgrades, modernization of data collection, storage, and analysis capabilities, improved awareness and education, professional development, collaborative innovation, and promotion of legal and ethical issues as ways of advancing universal access to energy by 2030. Going forward, more collaborations between academic and research institutions and energy producers will help produce experts and professionals to propel innovative deployment of digital technologies in the energy sector.}

We contribute to the literature by examining the impact of adapting payment terms during and after disruptions. In particular, we perform a discrete event simulation analysis in anyLogistix for a complex supply chain network to investigate the impact of adjusting payment terms on supply chain cash flows. Our results suggest that collaboratively adjusting payment terms is an effective strategy for coping with disruptions. In contrast, ad hoc adjustments and immediate returns to pre-disruption payment schemes do not yield visible improvements. Positive effects on cash and loans are observed if an adjustment of payment terms occurs proactively and in a coordinated manner, especially when expediting payments downstream and payment slowing down upstream. The results from our sensitivity analysis on the impact of accelerating/decelerating cash conversion cycles favour shorter cycles when coping with disruptions. We deduce useful managerial insights and reveal some new theoretical tensions related to the impact of payment adjustments on cash flows in supply chains.}

The study draws upon a comprehensively labeled 5G-NIDD dataset covering a broad spectrum of network behaviors, from benign real-user traffic to various attack scenarios. Our data preprocessing and experimental design have been carefully structured to eradicate any data leakage, a standout feature of our methodology that significantly improves the robustness and dependability of our results compared to prior studies. The ML models are evaluated using various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, and execution time. Our results reveal that the K-Nearest Neighbors model is superior in accuracy and ROC AUC, while the Voting Classifier stands out in precision and F1-score. Decision Tree, Bagging, and Extra Trees models exhibit strong recall scores. In contrast, the AdaBoost model falls short across all assessed metrics. Despite displaying only modest performance on other metrics, the Naive Bayes model excels in computational efficiency, offering the quickest execution time. This paper emphasizes the importance of understanding various ML models' distinct strengths, drawbacks, and trade-offs for network intrusion detection. It highlights that no single model is universally superior, and the choice hinges on the nature of the dataset, specific application requirements, and the computational resources available.}

abstract = {The recent COVID-19 pandemic, Ukrainian-Russian conflict, China-US trade war, and current environmental concerns regarding carbon emissions have all made the semiconductor supply chain (SCSC) more vulnerable. In addition, the uncertainty of global SCSC is increasingly obscured owing to several resilience challenges within the exiting supply chain network. Thus, supply chain resilience issues are becoming popular among researchers and policymakers. Unfortunately, there is a lack of systematic research on evaluation of resilience challenges and mitigation strategies for the global SCSC. Additionally, existing models are incompetent to capture the optimistic and pessimistic views of experts during interaction assessment and mitigation strategy evaluation in an uncertain environment. Hence, this research, for the first time, develops a novel integrated Decomposed Fuzzy Set (DFS)-based Delphi, Weighted Influence Non-linear Gauge System (WINGS), and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) model to identify and assess strength-interaction relationship between resilience challenges and mitigation strategies. The findings demonstrated that out of thirteen resilience challenges, seven were identified as causal group resilience challenges while the remaining six were classified as result group resilience challenges indicating that addressing the causal group resilience challenges may directly influence the mitigation of the result group resilience challenges. According to findings of DFS-WINGS analysis, the resilience challenges “Geopolitical tensions” and “Natural disasters” are the two most priority causal group resilience challenges that can significantly influence the result group system components. Furthermore, the DSF-QFD analysis confirmed that the mitigation strategies “Investing in semiconductor R&D and developing regional semiconductor manufacturing facilities” and “Diversification of key components suppliers and promoting domestic manufacturing” received the highest correlation among the mitigation strategies to address the current resilience issues faced by global SCSC. The study findings make a significant contribution to policymaking. The roles of resilience challenges and importance of mitigation strategies both can be used as benchmarks for the SCSC to make the global SCSC more resilient and sustainable.}

The augmented mean group estimator is employed for empirical evaluation, exhibiting that natural resource rent is negatively related to economic growth by 0.30%; therefore, it affirms the resource curse paradox. In contrast, EGOVT and institutional quality promote economic growth by 0.65% and 0.10%, respectively. The moderating term of natural resources and EGOVT elevates economic growth by 0.25%, converting the resource-curse into a resource blessing. It indicates that digital governance would help to mitigate negative impact of resource abundance on growth. Alternative panel estimator also authenticates the estimated result and offer valuable policy implications to all stakeholders.}

In developing the framework, this study employs configurative and aggregative synthesis approaches through an extensive literature review and in-depth case study analysis of publications spanning from 2018 to 2023. The study identifies key factors driving the co-evolution of AI and IoT into AIoT and specifies technical components constituting the architecture of AIoT in smarter eco-cities. A comparative analysis reveals commonalities and differences among City Brain, SUM, and platform urbanism within the frameworks of AIoT and environmental governance. These data-driven systems collectively contribute to environmental governance in smarter eco-cities by leveraging real-time data analytics, predictive modeling, and stakeholder engagement. The proposed framework underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making, optimization of resource management, reduction of environmental impact, collaboration among stakeholders, engagement of citizens, and formulation of evidence-based policies. The findings unveils that the synergistic and collaborative integration of City Brain, SUM, and platform urbanism through AIoT presents promising opportunities and prospects for advancing environmental governance in smarter eco-cities. The framework not only charts a strategic trajectory for stimulating research endeavors but also holds significant potential for practical application and informed policymaking in the realm of environmental urban governance. However, ongoing critical discussions and refinements remain imperative to address the identified challenges, ensuring the framework's robustness, ethical soundness, and applicability across diverse urban contexts.}

One such autonomous system is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), although their wrong use could be potentially hazardous to humans and the environment. Given its relative novelty in construction, there remains a dearth of knowledge about safety risks associated with their use as well as knowledge on skills and protocols for their safe operation. With construction being one of the most dangerous and accident-prone sectors, there is even more impetus to develop UAV safety competence. In this study, we explore the application of immersive virtual reality (VR) use for purposes of safety training pertaining to the use of UAVs in construction scenarios. Whereas, previous studies, focussed on effectiveness of VR as a tool for training individuals on UAV operations and safety risks in general, this study evaluates its effectiveness across distinctive themes of safety in order to compare its effectiveness in different domains of UAV safety. The study adopts design science for development of bespoke UAV safety training tool in VR using Building Information Modelling (BIM) and game engine-driven virtual prototyping. The immersive training tool was then applied in an experiment of participants (n = 100) with (n = 50) constituting a control group using more traditional training methods and a series of pre/post-test assessments. The findings confirmed the relative superiority of VR training over traditional methods, improving performance and retention by up to 22 % on average. The immersive VR was found to be most effective on participants retention of knowledge in general flight preparation, air traffic documentation, visibility management and warning signals. Further usability tests were performed on all participants (n = 100) revealing general presence and positive attitudes towards VR based UAV safety training when compared to traditional training. From a practice perspective this research proofs the effectiveness of a VR approach as more cost effective and safe approach to UAV training for both academia and practice with added advantage of being more realistic simulation of the UAV risk scenarios.}

abstract = {Statement of problem
Maxillofacial prosthodontists were advanced digital technology (ADT) adopters early in the new Millennium. The past two decades saw a range of digital enablers emerge including digital imaging (internal and surface), digital surgical planning, digital functional assessment, subtractive and additive manufacturing, navigation, and robotics among others. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the latest ADT arrival that will be a challenging disruptive technology. ADT has served as a profound change agent in maxillofacial prosthodontics. The intent was to explore the process and level of ADT engagement in maxillofacial prosthodontics.
Purpose
The purpose was twofold. Firstly, to explore maxillofacial prosthodontic engagement of ADT. Secondly, to develop a discussion document to assist the American Academy of Maxillofacial Prosthetics (AAMP) with establishing a collective awareness and considered opinion on the future of maxillofacial prosthodontics in the digital era.
Material and methods
AAMP member interest in ADT was assessed through analysis of AAMP annual congress programs and publications in the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry (JPD). The history of the maxillofacial prosthodontic journey to the digital era was undertaken with a selective literature review. The perceptions maxillofacial prosthodontists hold on ADT engagement was assessed through a survey of AAMP members. Developing an understanding of the influence AI was conducted with a review of pertinent literature.
Results
From 2011–2020, an annual mean of 38% of papers published in the JPD involved clinical use of ADT. From 2017–2019, 44% of invited presentations at AAMP annual congresses included clinical use of ADT. The journey to the digital era distinguished three periods with formative and consolidation periods influencing the innovation digital era. The AAMP member survey had a 59% response rate and studied 10 domains through 31 questions. Of the respondents, 89% thought ADT important to the future of maxillofacial prosthodontics.
Conclusions
The discussion document will assist the AAMP in developing a collective consciousness and considered opinion on ADT in the future of maxillofacial prosthodontics. Members of the AAMP have a developed interest in clinical applications of ADT. A great challenge is that no formal education, training, or clinical competency requirements for ADT could be identified. Clinical competency requirements are important to prepare maxillofacial prosthodontics for the inevitability of a digital era future. The discussion document poses the fundamental question of whether maxillofacial prosthodontists will remain as passive end users of ADT and AI or will they become engaged knowledge workers that have determined clinical competency in ADT and AI in patient care. Without this knowledge worker role, maxillofacial prosthodontists may experience difficulty being part of the inevitable ADT-AI driven future.}

Drawing on Symposium delegate expert responses to open-ended questions, our coding-based thematic analysis suggest three primary enablers drive successful adoption of AMM technologies at scale, namely: the ability to leverage pre-competitive collaborations to challenge-based problem solving; information and knowledge sharing through centres of excellence; and the development of AMM specific regulatory standards. Further analysis of expert responses identified the emergence of a ‘Platform creation’ approach to AMM innovation; characterised by: i) New collaboration modes; ii) Exploration of common product-process platforms for new dosage forms and therapy areas; iii) Development of modular equipment assets that enable scale-out, and offer more decentralized or distributed manufacturing models; iv) Standards based on product-process platform archetypes; v) Implementation strategies where platform-thinking and AMM technologies can significantly reduce timelines between discovery, approval and GMP readiness. We provide a definition of the Platform creation concept for AMM and discuss the requirements for its systematic development.}

In this sense, an appropriate valuation of ZT intellectual property (IP) uncovers future challenges with ZT principles to both scholars and Federal enterprises. Therefore, this research attempts to understand the marginal effects of having ZT IP on Federal enterprise governance in terms of return on government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and e-participation. We collected objective data from Derwent Innovation (Clarivate Analytics) and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO IP Statistics) to test the interplay of the 1297 ZT strategic patent with Federal enterprise governance. Through panel regression models using fixed effects, we conduct Heckman correction model analyses and the generalized moment method (GMM) to alleviate potential sampling biases and endogeneity. The findings suggest that ZT strategic patent is positively related to both government effectiveness and regulatory quality but without any effect on e-participation. Furthermore, we find that diverse technological IP portfolios in ZT technologies do not strengthen the effects of ZT strategic patent on Federal enterprises.}

We noticed a critical research gap when we performed an extensive literature review. Although there are many studies available that assess the readiness of companies for I4, only a few deal with decision-making in terms of sustainable development, and none have applied that to the automotive industry. Practitioners can apply the proposed model to determine the strategy based on technological developments in I4. The current paper proposes an extended version of the combined compromise solution approach with the help of the picture fuzzy sets. According to the paper's results, by using the proposed model, developing a new business model based on technological improvements is the best strategy for the digital transformation of the automotive industry. Also, the lack of research and development implementations on I4 implementation is the most influential factor. Hence, practitioners in the automotive industry know the significance of research and development in reaching successful results for digital transformation. The acquired outcomes of the paper show that developing technology-based new business models is the best strategy for the automotive manufacturing industry concerning digital transformation instead of accommodating traditional business models and high technology utilization.}

We integrated the GMM-SYS estimator with analyses of a balanced panel database of all the provinces in Italy between the period 2013–2021. The use of a high level of spatial granularity in an under-researched context revealed two distinct scenarios. In competitive markets, a more entrepreneurial and less widespread form of corruption emerged which may enhance market efficiency (bottom-up pattern). Conversely, in a context with limited market competition and low institutional quality, corruption indicators may be less useful due to potential pre-bribery behavior (top-down pattern). Our study underscores the capacity of corrupt suppliers to exploit market opportunities and secure selection. We found that corruption risk practices within public contracts have the potential to improve market efficiency, thus rendering them appealing to corrupt suppliers due to their capacity to deliver economic advantages. This also applies to provinces with high-quality governance. Additionally, the paper highlights the limitations of indicators in alternative contexts. The paper has significant implications for policymakers in defining assignation criteria in high-quality contexts, but also offers insights into the effectiveness of grand corruption indicators for academics.}

Financial innovations, such as financial technology or fintech, have gained increasing global attention as powerful tools for financial inclusion and socioeconomic development. In this study, we explore the potential of technologically-enabled financial innovation to bring unbanked segments of society into the formal financial system and the repercussions of such innovation on financial stability during the pandemic. However, the excitement around fintech has also masked its risks to the financial system and low-income people. We analyze the interrelationships among fintech, financial inclusion, and financial stability through a systematic literature review of 163 academic articles published between 2010 and 2023. We seek to fill the knowledge gaps in these subject areas by (1) mapping the fintech-driven financial inclusion field, (2) synthesizing the findings to develop a conceptual framework, and (3) discussing theoretically sound future research directions. This study is related to innovation with a focus on finance, contributing to a small but growing literature on the role of inclusive innovation and fintech-driven financial inclusion in promoting inclusive development and poverty alleviation, particularly in emerging economies. We also explore the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the interactive roles of financial capabilities and regulatory and supervisory frameworks in the interrelationships above.}

This novel paradigm has gained widespread acceptance from governments globally, positioning itself as a cornerstone in the practical implementation of the DE. The increasing reliance on digital means for economic transformation, the treatment of data as a critical resource, and the integration of information technologies highlight the synergy between AI and the DE. Against this backdrop, online reviews and SA play a pivotal role, offering rich data streams continually emerging on various platforms. Therefore, this article utilizes a probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) to establish a multi-granularity probabilistic linguistic (MG-PL) information system. This approach, through sentiment analysis (SA), enables quantitative analysis of user emotional expressions. The integration of these technological aspects holds the promise of enhancing decision-making processes, facilitating the intellectualization of economic activities, and addressing existing challenges in the application of AI within the DE domain. Initially, SA is conducted on text-based online comment data, forming a probabilistic linguistic incomplete information system. The maximum similarity method is employed to establish a probabilistic linguistic complete information system. Subsequently, an adjustable MG-PL decision-theoretic rough set (DTRS) is developed, followed by the establishment of a three-way group decision model using three-way decisions (3WD) and a directed graph. The model’s applicability, stability, and feasibility are demonstrated via a case study centered on the acquisition of new energy vehicles (NEVs).}

Several empirical studies supported the FRC hypothesis, while some verified the resource blessing. Given the evolving landscape of global economies and the increasing integration of digital technologies, there's a motivation to explore the role of digitalization in shaping financial outcomes alongside natural resources. In this regard, the study aims to elucidate the combined impact of both natural resources (NR) and digitalization (DIG) on financial institution access (FIA), financial institution efficiency (FIE), and financial institution depth (FID) from 2001 to 2022 for ten resource-generating nations. For empirical evaluations, a panel-correlated standard error (PCSE) estimator is employed, which exhibits that NR validates the FRC paradox and adversely affects FIA, FID, and FIE by 0.084%, 0.166%, and 0.03%. In contrast, DIG stimulates FIA by 0.124%, FID by 0.043 and FIE by 0.065%, respectively. Besides, when the resource-endowed countries are embodied with DIG, it triggers FIA, FID, and FIE by 0.017%, 0.024%, and 0.041%. It implies that conducive digital developments have the potential to deviate the FRC problem into a blessing for these resource-intensive economies. In addition, similar findings are endorsed from generalized least squares (GLS) with variant magnitudes and significance levels. The study provides valuable policy implications for all financial analysts, policymakers, and stakeholders.}

abstract = {To address ambiguity arising from linguistic decision judgments, Guo and Zhao introduced a model of the well-known Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method, Best-Worst Method (BWM), using fuzzy sets, known as Fuzzy Best–Worst Method (FBWM). Despite its versatility, FBWM has limitations, such as criteria-weights being independent of fuzzy comparison values’ shape and reliance on approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations. In response to these limitations, we introduce a novel model of Fuzzy Best–Worst Method based on α-cut intervals. In this model, the calculation of optimal weights involves formulating an optimization problem that utilizes exact fuzzy arithmetic operations defined in terms of α-cut intervals. This approach aims to optimize the entire shape of fuzzy comparison values simultaneously. However, it turns out that, although we have proven the existence of optimal solution for this problem, solving it proves to be challenging. To resolve this issue, we approximate optimal weight set(s) using triangular fuzzy weight sets and assess the Error of Approximation (EA). The approximate weight set with the desired EA is then defuzzified to obtain a crisp weight set. In situations where there are multiple approximate weight sets with the same EA, interval-weights are calculated. Following that, we establish the necessary conditions for a Fuzzy Pairwise Comparison System (FPCS) to be consistent. Using these conditions, we calculate a lower bound of the Consistency Index (CI), providing a measure of the accuracy of weights. Finally, we discuss numerical examples and a real-world scenario, ranking of risk factors in supply chain 4.0, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.}

abstract = {In industrial landscapes, spool fabrication industries play a crucial role in the successful completion of numerous industrial projects by providing prefabricated modules. However, the implementation of digitalized sustainable practices in spool fabrication industries is progressing slowly and is still in its embryonic stage due to several challenges. To implement digitalized sustainable manufacturing (SM), digital technologies such as Internet of Things, Cloud computing, Big data analytics, Cyber-physical systems, Augmented reality, Virtual reality, and Machine learning are required in the context of sustainability. The scope of the present study entails prioritization of the enablers that promote the implementation of digitalized sustainable practices in spool fabrication industries using the Improved Fuzzy Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (IMF-SWARA) method integrated with Triangular Fuzzy Bonferroni Mean (TFBM). The enablers are identified through a systematic literature review and are validated by a team of seven experts through a questionnaire survey. Then the finally identified enablers are analyzed by the IMF-SWARA and TFBM integrated approach. The results indicate that the most significant enablers are management support, leadership, governmental policies and regulations to implement digitalized SM. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of digital SM enablers in the spool fabrication industry and offers guidelines for the transformation of conventional systems into digitalized SM practices.}

This article begins with a bibliometric analysis and a systematic review, followed by a discussion of insights obtained from the literature through the lens of strong structuration theory. The results include a description of the new paradigm of future-oriented and responsible physical-digital convergence, a research agenda, and the proposal of the structure – agency (SA)–DT framework to guide advances in Industry 5.0 with digital twins. A concept-centric analysis is used to identify use cases, impacts, redesigned forms of physical–digital interaction, challenges, and the changes in both human and non-human agents increasingly intertwined in more advanced DT solutions. Moreover, this study reveals how digital twins can be deployed to address, in an integrated manner, the three main pillars of Industry 5.0: human-centric, sustainable, and resilient industry transformation. Practitioners may find our contribution helpful for their Industry 5.0 roadmaps, which require more ample interaction with society at all levels and evidence of responsible practices for current and future generations.}

However, within such a complex architecture, achieving patient-centric data access still presents trustworthiness challenges of transmission security and usage reliability. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) and blockchain are both the promising primitives that support patients with secure access control over their data. Nevertheless, both have their unique key management issues. In this paper, we propose a novel patient-centric and trusted data access (PCT-DA) system in blockchain-enabled IoMT. Firstly, we develop an online/offline encryption and verifiable outsourced decryption CP-ABE scheme to relieve the computation pressure on patients and users. Secondly, we design a flexible attribute-based key management mechanism to overcome the security drawbacks of encryption and attribute keys, such as single point of failure, key escrow and privacy leakage. Finally, we build a trusted integrity audit contract to guarantee the incentive fairness between patients and users in access services. Moreover, theoretical analyses prove that the PCT-DA system not only achieves confidentiality, integrity, traceability and forward/backward security, but also guarantees static security under random oracles. Simulation experiments indicate that our proposal reduces the time cost by approximately 14.10 seconds over state-of-the-art and is more practical in blockchain-enabled IoMT system.}

This paper investigates the contributions and drawbacks of DTs to resilient performance (RP), an aspect that so far has received less attention in comparison to others such as efficiency. To this end, a survey questionnaire was applied to 79 academics and practitioners linked to resilience engineering. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics and a thematic analysis of the open-text responses to the survey. Mixed impacts were identified, with 10 themes related to contributions and 16 to drawbacks. Regarding the contributions, the results highlighted the use of DTs for monitoring and anticipating system performance. Machine learning seems to be the most promising approach for this purpose. A key drawback is the need for developing new skills across the workforce so that they can make sense of the outputs of DTs and are aware of their strengths and weaknesses. The human role is expected to remain crucial for RP, which makes the current coordination difficulties with DTs even more important to address. A research agenda composed of five topics is proposed, encompassing description, prescription, and assessment. The agenda emphasizes the need for mapping the attributes or functionalities of DTs onto resilience concepts, models, and frameworks.}

The findings culminated in a novel conceptual framework, which captures the intricate interplay between the discourse of agency, prevailing conditions, and the resultant discourse of strategy. Central to this model is the discourse of agency, framing cybersecurity as either a high agency mechanism actively contributing to business objectives, or a low agency mechanism perceived as a passive burden. The conditions under which businesses operate, characterized by external pressures and internal motivations, alongside the degree of environmental support, further shape their cybersecurity narratives. These dynamics significantly influence the resultant discourse of strategy, leading to four distinct strategic narratives: Synergistic Asset, Operational Pragmatism, Ambivalent Prospect, and Impractical Liability. For instance, a discourse of Synergistic Asset reflects a perception of an environment positively influenced by robust governmental cybersecurity initiatives, setting benchmarks in cybersecurity practices. Conversely, a discourse of Impractical Liability reflects pronounced levels of risk, influenced by societal narratives and economic apprehensions. We offer a comprehensive model for understanding cybersecurity discourses, bridging empirical findings with theoretical underpinnings, and providing valuable insights for both academia and industry.}

The investigation is anchored in a resource-based view (RBV) and examines the strategic comportment of banks vis-à-vis FinTech enterprises. Utilizing a dataset that encompasses pre-Brexit European FinTech firms from 2006 to 2019, we implement logistic regression models for our primary analysis. Propensity score matching is invoked to mitigate selection bias, and machine learning techniques are applied to address data imbalance. The empirical evidence demonstrates that FinTech firms backed by BVC exhibit superior profitability and asset performance compared to their non-BVC-backed counterparts. The robustness of these findings persists even after accounting for selection bias and data imbalance. The study posits that bank-affiliated venture capital serves as a pivotal criterion for FinTech entrepreneurs in investor selection, thereby enriching the scholarly discourse on the symbiotic relationship between traditional banking institutions and emergent financial technologies within a European context characterized by information asymmetry and resource-based complementarities.}

As a result, it is seen as the cornerstone of Industry 4.0 and the wave of innovation to come since it connects virtual cyberspace with actual physical entities. Virtualization of machinery control, use of data analysis in decision-making, and information flow through the Internet are some trends in Industrial Digital Twins (IDTs). IDT is one of the possible digital technologies that are currently being developed to facilitate digital transformation and decision-making in many industrial sectors. Even after more than two decades, the concept of digital twin is continuously developing, taking new forms like IDT as it permeates industries and applications. This has led to an ever-growing diversity of definitions, which poses a danger to the concept’s clarity and might result in the technology’s use ineffectively. To define what qualifies an IDT and what does not, there is a requirement for a comprehensive description with well-defined criteria. A digital representation of a physical process enables safe management, remote control, and simulations of the process. This paper offers recommendations for creating a Digital Twin architecture that incorporates the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and modern technology, integrating aforementioned features in an experimental application. Additionally, the article concentrates on the IDT characteristics, major technological practices behind IDT, related sustainable solutions, and major use-cases. Furthermore, the existing challenges are explored with a specific focus on the open issues and related future opportunities.}

To address this research objective, this study valuably adds to the empirical literature by investigating the role of FinTech and energy transition in economic growth to manage minerals. To accomplish this goal, panel data of the top 10 resource-rich economies that range from 1990 to 2022 based on novel panel estimations such as Cross-sectional autoregressive distributive lag (CS-ARDL) and panel Granger non-causality (Juodis et al., 2021) is taken. The outcomes of the study discovered that FinTech is positively influencing GDP in both the long- and short-run. The robust outcomes further reveal that minerals management (coal, oil, minerals, and forests) becomes a part of enriching GDP to confirm the resources blessing theory. The study analysis sets down the practical implications of formulating sustainable economic development policies for stakeholders.}

abstract = {In the face of increasing global disruptions, the cybersecurity field is confronting rising threats posed by offensive groups and individual hackers. Traditional security measures often fall short in detecting and mitigating these sophisticated attacks, necessitating advanced intrusion detection methods. The goal of our study is to develop robust network intrusion detection methods using machine learning techniques. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of various machine learning models in detecting network intrusions. Model performances are optimized through hyperparameter tuning and feature selection. A range of classification and clustering models have been employed. Data from SIEM systems capturing real-time statistics from cloud-hosted Windows virtual machines has been gathered and augmented with web attack logs from CICIDS2017, each comprising approximately fifteen thousand rows. Hyperparameter tuning, data normalization, standardization and feature selection techniques for model optimization have been used in our study. The research showcases the potential of machine learning in enhancing network intrusion detection capabilities. The findings underscore the effectiveness of the Random Forest Classifier (0.97) and highlight the importance of utilizing diverse datasets and advanced optimization techniques. This study offers valuable insights and sets a foundation for future advancements in cybersecurity strategies and intrusion detection systems.}

abstract = {The advanced stage of Industry 4.0 is characterized by the integration and interaction between physical and virtual spaces, and Digital Twin (DT) technology, congruent with this vision, has garnered extensive attention and has undergone large-scale implementation. Yet, in the practical implementation of Digital Twin projects, several issues persist: ① How to formulate reasonable task objectives and action plans before project implementation? ② how to determine and assess the development level of the digital twin during project implementation? ③ How to evaluate the effectiveness of digital twin after project completion and how to enhance improvement in the next steps? Consequently, a methodological model is urgently needed to evaluate the development process of Digital Twins, offering a benchmark for their design, development, and appraisal. To address these issues, this paper introduces a five-level Digital Twin Maturity Model (DTMM), which systematically aligns DT capabilities, phased objectives, and technical requirements within a unified framework, creating a theoretical system capable of assessing DT’s developmental level and specifying its construction trajectory. Further, this paper catalogs supporting tools aligned with the technical specifications stipulated in DTMM’s functional capabilities, aiding developers in devising implementation strategies. Additionally, it scrutinizes the application status across six DT vertical sectors, conducts maturity evaluations, and confirms the efficacy of the proposed model. The conclusion can be drawn that DT is still in its embryonic phase. This work aspires to assist project managers and public policymakers gain a more objective understanding of Digital Twin, offering references to facilitate their positive development and broader implementation.}

DTs can significantly enhance our society and quality of life through the virtualization of a real-world physical system, providing greater insights about their operations and assets, as well as enhancing their resilience through real-time monitoring and proactive maintenance. DTs also pose significant security risks, as intellectual property is encoded and more accessible, as well as their continued synchronization to their physical counterparts. The rapid proliferation and dynamism of cyber threats in today’s digital environments motivate the development of automated and intelligent cyber solutions. Today’s industrial transformation relies heavily on artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML) and data-driven technologies that allow machines to perform tasks such as self-monitoring, investigation, diagnosis, future prediction, and decision-making intelligently. However, to effectively employ AI-based models in the context of cybersecurity, human-understandable explanations, and their trustworthiness, are significant factors when making decisions in real-world scenarios. This article provides an extensive study of explainable AI (XAI) based cybersecurity modeling through a taxonomy of AI and XAI methods that can assist security analysts and professionals in comprehending system functions, identifying potential threats and anomalies, and ultimately addressing them in DT environments in an intelligent manner. We discuss how these methods can play a key role in solving contemporary cybersecurity issues in various real-world applications. We conclude this paper by identifying crucial challenges and avenues for further research, as well as directions on how professionals and researchers might approach and model future-generation cybersecurity in this emerging field.}

Market risk is gauged through primary risk metrics commonly used in industry and academia, such as Standard Deviation (SD), Value at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES), and Expected Loss (EL). In exploring financial inclusion, we consider twelve specific indicators that span three crucial dimensions: penetration, availability, and usage. Our analysis covers data from 49 countries spanning the period from 2004 to 2021, encompassing G20 nations and markets hosting major global stock exchanges. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between various indicators of financial inclusion and certain risk characteristics. Notably, distinctions emerge between underdeveloped and developed countries. In the case of developed nations, for instance, the quantity of active mobile money accounts and mobile money agent outlets exhibits a robust correlation with market risk. Through quantile correlation analysis, we discern that the relationship between risk and financial inclusion undergoes shifts based on the level of inclusion. Therefore, despite the documented advantages of financial inclusion, our study sheds light on its potential adverse implications.}

One such network is the supply chain which has an interrelation with Industry 4.0. Any disruption to Industry 4.0 will ripple through its entire supply chain and will lead to cascading effects. Thus, there is a need to examine how to minimize the disruption of I4.0 and make its dependent supply chain more functional and cost-saving. To that end, the aim of this research is threefold: (i) modeling the dependence between fourth industrial revolution and supply chain performance using the Bayesian network, (ii) capturing how a disruption in one network may propagate through the entire network and impact its overall robustness, (iii) conducting a series of advance analyses including belief propagation, sensitivity analysis, and information theory approach to validate the result and draw further insights. As a result of these analyses, it was found that technological factors and supplier quality are vital to the I4.0 disruption and performance of supply chain performance.}

It demonstrates that Chinese lawmakers adopt a dual-protection paradigm consisting of data privacy law and family law to protect children's personal information. In the field of data privacy law, China's Personal Information Protection Law regards children's personal information as sensitive information, and provides all contexts-based protection through the parental consent system, resulting in severe restrictions on children's freedom of access to information and their evolving capacities. In the field of family law, the Minors Protection Law fragments the right to informational self-determination of children while applying hard legal paternalism with respect to the online live-broadcast for children, limiting children's fundamental right to freedom of expression and depriving parents of the right to the custody of their children. Based on research in developmental psychology, this article argues that different legal frameworks should be adopted according to different age groups of children to protect the best interest of the child. In this way, the balance between the protection and informational self-determination of children in the digital era can be achieved.}

Amidst the architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) sector’s transformation through policy-supported digitalization and digital twin (DT) advocacy, it remains unclear how general contracting firms (GCFs) will react to growing cyber-attack threats linked to DTs. Transformation initiatives around DTs scarcely consider the implications of how firms implementing such innovations (e.g., GCFs) could jeopardize the cybersecurity of the connected wider built environment and society. This paper unpacks the cybersecurity threat landscape of DT technologies for GCFs – as central organisations in the delivery of built infrastructure – through a critical synthesis of literature with emphasis on the cyber, physical, and social dimensions. It reviews common cyber vulnerabilities and threats linked to DTs and provides a cross-industry vulnerability analysis for GCFs in a sector known for a laissez-faire approach to cybersecurity. Vulnerabilities are categorized into a cyber, physical, and social taxonomy for construction, and four propositions for future considerations are developed.}

They are use-case-agnostic and do not require a huge amount of information. In addition to this, three possible new applications of these indicators for distribution system operators and regulatory authorities are identified and discussed. The extensive use of these indicators in Europe could allow the development of fruitful collaborations between distribution system operators, allow the identification of cause–effect relations between grid performance and digital infrastructure, and improve the replicability of innovative smart grid solutions. However, this will only be possible if regulators promote the adoption of the proposed indicators and the dissemination of their results.}

However, assessing the privacy of digital products is challenging given the opaque and evolving nature of the digital economy. Many schools share the responsibility for assessing edtech with education departments and authorities; however, to date, there has been very little empirical or theoretical work on how schools, education departments and authorities evaluate the privacy risks and data practices associated with the digital products used in schools. Drawing on an analysis of the Safer Technologies 4 Schools (ST4S) framework developed by Education Services Australia, education department policies, as well as interviews with education department staff and representatives, we examine how the data practices of digital products are examined in government schools in Australia and how schools are supported to choose tools that demonstrate best practice in terms of protecting students’ digital privacy. Findings suggest that while the goal of the ST4S framework is to streamline and unify digital privacy standards across states and territories, the complexity of the Australian education system, the number and diversity of digital products used, and the different governance approaches across the country make this difficult. Our conclusions reveal a compliance culture towards children's digital privacy, rather than a best practice approach, and a trust (or even ‘overtrust’) in ‘big tech’. However, we note some promising developments in this area and make recommendations for future research.}

In parallel, each company needs to effectively manage information and knowledge to successfully implement its strategy. Thus, this study focuses on the points where knowledge, information, and entrepreneurial management meet, with special attention paid to the relationship between information management (IM) and knowledge management (KM) as well as their mediating roles in shaping firm performance. This study aims to identify the role of information management (IM) and knowledge management (KM) in shaping performance in entrepreneurial firms. Moreover, the study aims to examine the causal relationship between IM and KM. Our sample consisted of 150 small and medium-sized firms that manufacture furniture in Poland. This is a mix-method study; it uses structural equitation modeling (SEM), fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), and interview-based qualitative analysis to examine the associations among entrepreneurial orientation (EO), IM, KM, and firm performance. In particular, three types of outcomes are analyzed; namely, firm competitiveness (FC), firm growth (FG), and financial performance (FP). The results unveiled the impact of IM on KM; the findings also showed the positive role of EO in shaping IM and KM as well as firm performance. In general, IM and KM impact firm performance; however, their individual impacts depend on the performance type (when they interact, they constitute a sufficient condition for achieving a high level of performance regardless of the type). These findings contribute to the IM and KM literature as well as entrepreneurship and small business research.}

There is an increasing usage of UAVs in various fields of civil applications including live tracking, wireless connectivity, distribution of goods, remote sensing, protection and surveillance, precision agriculture, and review of civil infrastructure. UAVs or drones have a tremen- dous potential to provide smart farming with various productive solutions. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies together with UAVs are anticipated to transform agriculture, allowing decision- making in days rather than weeks, offering substantial cost savings and yield increases. These technologies are employed in a number of different ways, from monitoring crop status and amount of moisture in soil in real time to using drones to help with activities such as the application of pesticide spray. Nonethe- less, the employment of such IoT and smart networking technol- ogy, exposes the smart farming ecosystem to cyber security risks and vulnerabilities. This survey gives a detailed understanding of UAV applications in Precision Agriculture (PA). In this survey, we demonstrate a comprehensive analysis on security and privacy in a smart farming scenario. In this complex and dispersed cyber- physical environment, we describe how Blockchain technology along with 5 G in UAVs communication network can dissipate the security issues of the network. The survey addresses possible scenarios for cyber threats and the advancement in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence that can boost cybersecurity. At last, the survey outlines open research issues and future directions in the field of cybersecurity in UAVs and PA.}

These materials can absorb and release latent heat during phase transitions, facilitating thermal energy storage and temperature regulation. This comprehensive literature review explores various strategies and methods for implementing passive cooling with PCMs in buildings. The integration of PCMs enhances multiple passive cooling approaches, including solar control, ground cooling, ventilation-based heat dissipation, radiative cooling, and thermal mass-based heat modulation. The analysis delves into PCM classifications, encapsulation techniques, melting enthalpies, integration into diverse building envelopes, and performance across different climates. The findings from this comprehensive review indicated that PCM walls introduce a 2-hour delay in heat transfer and mitigate external temperature fluctuations. Windows equipped with PCM panels reduce heat transfer by 66 %. Combining PCMs with nocturnal radiative cooling leads to interior surface temperature reductions exceeding 13 °C. Natural ventilation with PCMs results in notable energy savings of up to 90 % in hot climates. The combination of free cooling and PCM thermal storage reduces charging times by 35 % while enhancing heat transfer. Simulations performed in the open literature suggested that strategic placement of PCMs in lightweight building walls reduces heat flux and overall energy consumption. Despite facing challenges related to scalability, compatibility, reliability, and recycling, PCM solutions demonstrate robust potential. When integrated thoughtfully into building design, PCMs significantly improve thermal performance and energy efficiency. Experimental validations confirm energy reductions ranging from 14 % to 90 %, underscoring the adaptability of passive cooling techniques leveraging PCM thermal storage and heat transfer capabilities across various climates.}

As a result, enhancing the resilience of CIs has emerged as a top priority for many countries, including the European Union. This involves not only understanding the threats/attacks themselves but also gaining knowledge about the areas and infrastructures that could potentially be affected. A European Union-funded project named PRECINCT (Preparedness and Resilience Enforcement for Critical INfrastructure Cascading Cyber-Physical Threats), under the Horizon 2020 program, tries to connect private and public stakeholders of CIs in a specific geographical area. The key objective of this project is to establish a common cyber-physical security management approach that will ensure the protection of both citizens and infrastructures, creating a secure territory. This paper presents the components of PRECINCT, including a directory of PRECINCT Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) blueprints. These blueprints support CI communities in designing integrated ecosystems, operating and replicating PRECINCT components (or toolkits). The integration enables coordinated security and resilience management, incorporating improved 'installation-specific' security solutions. Additionally, Serious Games (SG), and Digital Twins (DT) are a significant part of this project, serving as a novel vulnerability evaluation method for analysing complicated multi-system cascading effects in the PRECINCT Living Labs (LLs). The use of SG supports the concentrated advancement of innovative resilience enhancement services.}

As current health technology assessment (HTA) frameworks do not provide specific guidance on the assessment of medical artificial intelligence (AI), this study aimed to propose a conceptual framework for a broad HTA of medical AI.
Methods
A systematic literature review and a targeted search of policy documents was conducted to distill the relevant medical AI assessment elements. Three exemplary cases were selected to illustrate various elements: (1) An application supporting radiologists in stroke-care (2) A natural language processing application for clinical data abstraction (3) An ICU-discharge decision-making application.
Results
A total of 31 policy documents and 9 academic publications were selected, from which a list of 29 issues was distilled. The issues were grouped by four focus areas: (1) Technology & Performance, (2) Human & Organizational, (3) Legal & Ethical and (4) Transparency & Usability. Each assessment element was extensively discussed in the test, and the elements clinical effectiveness, clinical workflow, workforce, interoperability, fairness and explainability were further highlighted through the exemplary cases.
Conclusion
The current methodology of HTA requires extension to make it suitable for a broad evaluation of medical AI technologies. The 29-item assessment list that we propose needs a tailored approach for distinct types of medical AI, since the conceptualisation of the issues differs across applications.}

abstract = {Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are a major threat to computer networks. These attacks can be carried out by flooding a network with malicious traffic, overwhelming its resources, and/or making it unavailable to legitimate users. Existing machine learning methods for DDoS attack detection typically use statistical features of network traffic, such as packet sizes and inter-arrival times. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex relationships between different traffic flows. This paper proposes a new DDoS attack detection approach that uses Graph Neural Networks (GNN) ensemble learning. GNN ensemble learning is a type of machine learning that combines multiple GNN models to improve the detection accuracy. We evaluated our approach on the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection Evaluation Dataset (CICIDS2018) and CICIDS2017 datasets, a benchmark dataset for DDoS attack detection. Our work provides two main contributions. First, we extend our DDoS attack detection approach using GNN ensemble learning. Second, we explore the evaluation and fine-tuning of hyperparameter metrics through ensemble learning, significantly enhancing accuracy compared to a single GNN model and achieving an average 3.2% higher F1-score. Additionally, our approach effectively reduces overfitting by incorporating regularization techniques, such as dropout and early stopping. Specifically, we use a hierarchical ensemble of GNN, where each GNN learns the relationships between traffic flows at a different granularity level. We then use bagging and boosting to combine the predictions of the individual GNN, further improving detection accuracy. Results show that our system can achieve 99.67% accuracy, with a F1-score of 99.29%, which is better than state-of-the-art methods, even using single traffic architecture.}

Nevertheless, there has been a gradual switch in the selection of privacy-preserving technology. Predictive game-theoretic analytics for privacy preservation in IoT networks has received significant attention since it can effectively settle the conflicts between attackers and defenders. In this survey, we explain the basics of various games mainly applied for IoT privacy preservation, such as simultaneous game, stochastic game, bargain game, differential game, mean field game, aggregation game, Stackelberg game, signaling game, repeated game, evolutionary game, and cooperative game. We then explore different applications for game theory-based privacy preservation in IoT networks, followed by discussing the differences among the existing solution of privacy-preserving issues using different games under specific IoT scenarios. Moreover, we consider the challenges and outline future research directions. In conclusion, this survey not only presents existing work on applying game theory to preserve privacy in current IoT networks including smart grids, intelligent transportation systems, crowdsensing, edge-based IoT, integrated energy systems, blockchain IoT, Social IoT and Industrial IoT, but it also encourages researches to further dig deeper into rare areas.}

Unlike previous research, which often relies on limited datasets and classic methodologies, we leverage Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze Twitter data through advanced models of entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and community extraction, having persistence in Knowledge Graphs for consuming the intelligence efficiently. Results indicate that in the US midterm elections 2022, Arizona was the state that provided more content (507,551 tweets) related to a Chief Electoral Official, with 31.58% of them identified in the most aggressive cluster due to its mean attribute values of “attack on commenter” (0.7), “inflammatory” (∼0.3), “attack on author” (∼0.2), and “toxicity” (∼0.2). The name entity recognition model also identified an association between those aggressive tweets and the previous 2020 US Presidential campaign, characterized by attacks on election officials based on conspiracy theories campaigns. Knowledge graphs contributed to understanding the concentration of attacks and connectivity between topics commonly mentioned in hate speech content. Thus, our results offer detailed insights into the actors and dynamics of online harassment in electoral contexts, illuminating the challenges posed by harassment and proposing preventive mechanisms applicable to diverse electoral processes worldwide.}

In the context of Industry 4.0, the convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) represents a challenging yet pivotal avenue for bolstering network security. This amalgamation facilitates the establishment of an integrated SDN-IoT platform that adeptly confronts the security intricacies arising from the evolving landscape of interconnected devices and industrial networks. Through the strategic application of SDN, the network architecture undergoes dynamic segmentation, responsive to diverse parameters encompassing device attributes, application contexts, and security imperatives. This segmentation strategy effectively isolates IoT devices, constricting the potential attack surface and correspondingly diminishing the ramifications of security breaches. Therefore, this paper proposed a novel Adaptive Variational Autoencoder-based Modified Archery (AVA-MA) method to enhance the security of IoT devices. In this study, samples are collected and used from both the TON-IoT dataset and the SDN dataset to determine the effectiveness of the proposed AVA-MA method. The evaluation measures such as AUC, F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed AVA-MA method. The results depict the AVA-MA method attained an accuracy of 98.95%, precision of 97.54%, recall of 95.64%, and F1-score of 98.86% respectively.}

abstract = {Technological innovation and digitalization are transforming industries and organizations worldwide. Digital Maturity Models often serve as a reference point to monitor the digitalization progression through prescribed stages. Yet, little is still understood about (i) how a digital maturity model should be designed and deployed in a specific industry setting and (ii) the association between digital maturity and technology adoption. Building on extant literature and extensive interviews with industry experts, we first develop a digital maturity model in the context of the conformity assessment industry (a globally regulated industry responsible for assessing compliance of organizations with standards and regulations). Second, we implement the model and conduct a survey across 1447 organizations in 15 countries. Our findings reveal that the digital transformation journey of the industry progresses along five stages of maturity (with most organizations in the early/intermediate stages of digital maturity) with distinctive patterns of technical and managerial practices across all stages. Adoption of technologies is (unsurprisingly) associated with higher digital maturity levels - albeit that association does not hold for complex technologies (such as Blockchain) and is impacted by country specifics (measured by the Digital Skills Gap Index). Our study provides insights into digital maturity and the adoption of technologies in an institutional environment that is highly regulated and conservative, in which high integrity of service provision is primary, and digitalization is a secondary focus of organizations.}

abstract = {The establishment of financial institutions advances economic growth through various channels. Fintech readiness is one of the pillars that led to alterations in the financial industry, enhancing economic development and changing the dynamics of the resource market. Besides, new trade dynamics may intervene in this relationship in light of recent trends. Thus, we explore the integrated role of fintech readiness, digital trade, natural resource rents, and environmental policy stringency on the economic growth of selected OECD countries from 1990 to 2022. After examining the preliminary analysis, the study employs the Method of Moment Quantile Regression (MMQR). The estimated results indicated that mineral resource rent deteriorates economic growth and affirms the resource curse dilemma. In contrast, digital trade, fintech readiness, and environmental policy stringency contribute to enhancing economic performance. The influence of these growth indicators substantially varied at lower and higher growth quantiles and offered relevant policy implications.}

abstract = {Cybersecurity is critical in safeguarding sensitive information against evolving threats, especially in the healthcare sector, where Electronic Health Records (EHR) are central to the digital transformation of healthcare. This study takes a unique approach by investigating the influence of cybersecurity on healthcare professionals' use of EHR systems and its impact on their performance. It goes beyond the traditional adoption theories by integrating the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with cybersecurity and emotional trust and focuses on actual EHR system usage and its performance impact. The data from 459 healthcare professionals, analyzed using a Structural Equation Modeling-Artificial Neural Networks (SEM-ANN) approach, provides a comprehensive view of the dynamics involved. The findings suggest that cybersecurity's impact on the system's ease of use may vary by context. Ease of use was linked to trust but not directly to perceived usefulness. Importantly, systems perceived as efficient and beneficial are used more, leading to improved healthcare service quality. The study underscores the importance of robust cybersecurity measures and trust in effective EHR integration, offering valuable insights for enhancing EHR system acceptance and healthcare outcomes in Jordan.}
