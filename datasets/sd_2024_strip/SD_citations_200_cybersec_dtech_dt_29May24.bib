abstract = {Utilizing microdata from six provinces in East China, this study centers on the phenomenon of “fraud," employing a three-stage Probit model with dual sample selectivity to explore the impact of financial knowledge on residents' safeguarding of financial consumer rights and interests. This methodological approach effectively addresses estimation bias arising from concerns related to dual sample selectivity. The process of residents safeguarding their rights and interests when confronted with fraud unfolds in three sequential stages: “pre-fraud prevention, during fraud loss avoidance, and post-fraud rights protection." Key findings indicate that, on the whole, higher levels of financial knowledge foster residents' protection of financial consumer rights and interests. Specifically, heightened financial literacy is associated with an increased likelihood of encountering fraud, a reduced probability of incurring losses post-fraud, and an enhanced propensity for pursuing rights protection thereafter. Moreover, heterogeneity analysis reveals that the impact of financial knowledge is more pronounced among middle-aged and elderly individuals, rural inhabitants, and women. Furthermore, concerning various types of fraud, the amplification effect of financial knowledge is particularly evident in cases of telecom fraud and online fraud, though not in traditional fraud cases. Additionally, moderation effect analysis underscores that, overall, heightened attention to information, improved digital literacy, and increased social interaction can reinforce the positive influence of financial knowledge. This paper provides valuable insights for strengthening the protection of residents' financial rights and ensuring the security of their assets.}

In financial services, there is a broad spectrum of potential ethical issues, from data usage to customer vulnerabilities. This article scrutinizes the impact of morality and where accountability resides in the use of AI service robots in financial services. To address this challenge, we discuss the role of Corporate Digital Responsibility (CDR) for firms and illustrate how to implement a conceptual framework on the ethical implications of AI service robot applications, drawing on normative ethical theory. The framework elaborates on how the locus of morality (from human to AI agency) and moral intensity combine within context-specific AI service robot applications, and how this might influence associated accountability. We provide examples of AI robots’ use for different purposes, differentiating between four 'accountability clusters': (1) professional norms, (2) business responsibility, (3) inter-institutional normativity, and (4) supra-territorial regulations cluster. We also discuss the CDR implications in different clusters. Ethical implications of using AI service robots and associated accountability challenges are relevant for a network of actors—from customers and designers to firms and the government. Implementation of the framework incorporates a range of internal and external stakeholders that firms need to consider. We also provide a CDR roadmap to incorporate a time perspective and to inform implementation efforts.}

We used the systematic literature review, experts' assessment using the Delphi method, and quantitative analysis to attain this goal. Our research contributes to the literature by eliciting the structure and composition of the functional and non-functional requirements. The contributions include (1) identification and classification of 50 functional and 16 non-functional metaverse-related architecture requirements, (2) determination and relevancy of 15 most important functional and 6 non-functional requirements for digital public services provision, and (3) suitability assessment of the 21 services recommended for provision in the EU's metaverse platform with the highest potential to attract users. These findings show that governments pose unique requirements on the metaverse. Not all types of services are suitable for providing in the metaverse. Those focused on empowering citizens and helping them to develop are most important.}

These kinds of flexibility services are targeted as smart services to household consumers, promising them cost savings, optimal living conditions, and other benefits. The purpose of this paper is to examine the current demand and offering of these kinds of services in Finland. We performed an extensive consumer survey to untangle consumers’ potential, motivation, and engagement in flexibility services and surveyed the properties, similarities, and differences of the flexibility services in the markets. We then defined a quality dimensions framework for flexibility services, with which we evaluated the results to understand the required properties of the services from a consumer viewpoint and how the services respond to these requirements. The results show that Finnish household consumers are quite willing and ready for these kinds of services, and several services are currently available that fulfill some of the identified requirements. Most of the services are currently provided to larger customers, but it should be noted that there also exists demand among individual households. Therefore, clearer incentives, unambiguous definitions of responsibilities, and effortless service introductions are required to motivate consumer participation.}

Moreover, using new tools in so-called digitalization has become a core element, and while it may help firms sustain their competitive advantage, it could also have multiple side effects. Therefore, this paper adopts a service ecosystem perspective and focuses on firms’ level of digitalization to observe the effects of technologies regarded as actors, as well as deriving outlooks beyond the firm level. Additionally, a multilevel view is aligned with the digital service ecosystem and supports the analysis of Industry 4.0 as sociotechnical factors in smart manufacturing technologies. Using principal component analysis (PCA), an analysis of industries was conducted to identify where the modernization of manufacturing and the contribution of digitalization show lower levels of readiness. Furthermore, the purpose of the analysis is to alert firms about opportunities to gain the most from digitalization or to enhance their level of implementation of such technologies. A three-level view emerges because novel technology implementation ranges from companies to industries to regions; therefore, a general process of digitalization may also increase competitiveness at a wider level.}

This underscores the critical significance of digitalization investments, particularly in optimizing grid performance, managing renewable energy integration, and meeting evolving consumer demands. Despite the expected gains from digital technologies, their deployment in power distribution grids remains limited and partial. This study comprehensively examines the barriers hindering the digitalization of distribution grids, including the technical, organizational, regulatory, economic and human factors. By combining insights from existing literature with interviews with European DSO representatives, we have ranked the barriers by order of significance and identified those that need priority action. We ultimately provide policy guidance with practical recommendations and associated measures to overcome them. The outcomes of our joint analysis inform DSOs, policy-makers and field experts, and serve to formulate detailed policy recommendations to accelerate digitalization.}

Four properties of Digital Twin for Nuclear Reactor System (DTNRS) are summarized, which are given by the block definition diagram of MBSE philosophy. Then, to bridge the gap between numerical models and theoretical research of DT, a systematic and hierarchical “V” architecture is proposed, which reflects the digital-related technologies of the DTNRS throughout the whole life cycle. Furthermore, a four-layered decomposition construction model is developed and a prospective application scenario of DTNRS is pictured. Finally, the five-step instructive demonstration of the DTNRS is given based on a Generation III (GEN-III) reactor with its visualized condition map.}

Currently, different styles of metaverse integration education systems have been developed. In such cases, the selection of suitable systems is a crucial task for promoting the digitalization of higher education, considering their own resources endowment. Therefore, this study develops a hybrid outranking model for evaluating the metaverse integration educational options in higher education institutions with the interval-valued T-spherical fuzzy (IVTSF) setting. This model integrates the weighted Heronian mean aggregation (WHMA) operator, the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC), and the gained and lost dominance score (GLDS) with IVTSF information. The IVTSF-WHMA operator based on CRITIC is established to combine the appraisal data, which elucidates the capacity to encompass the reciprocal dependencies existing between the input data and experts. Then, the cross-entropy model is employed in the IVTSF setting for calculating the criteria weights, which can measure the discrimination information between criteria. Next, the IVTSF-GLDS model is presented to evaluate and rank the alternatives, which can reflect the individual and group attitudes. Finally, a case study for selecting metaverse integration educational options of university courses about supply chain management is organized to demonstrate the application of this presented hybrid outranking model. The result shows that the integration optionAo4(Metaverse adoption in online learning) is the most sustainable method for the humanities, with the largest dominance score (0.176). Further, we confirm the advantages of this framework through sensitivity and comparison investigations. The findings of this work indicate that the developed outranking model provides a more reliable and synthetic tool for evaluating the metaverse integration educational options within higher uncertain and complex circumstances.}

abstract = {Purpose of the study
This study examines the impact of financial development on financial inclusion and the moderating role of legal institutions in enhancing the effect of financial development on financial inclusion in sub-Sahara Africa. The previous literature does not explain how financial development could improve financial inclusion even though the systems theory of financial inclusion argues so.
Design/methodology/approach
Using data from WDI for 41 sub-Sahara Africa countries between, 2000–2020, a two-step system GMM and quantile regression models are used to estimate the objectives of the study. The study takes into consideration the exceptional impact of COVID-19 and the importance of internet usage, along with other macroeconomic factors.
Findings
The sys-GMM shows that financial development positively influences financial inclusion. Across diverse measures of financial development and estimation techniques, a consistent and significant positive relationship is observed. Furthermore, the quantile regression approach reveals that at the 25th,50th, and 75th quantile of financial inclusion, the effect of financial development is positive. In both the sys-GMM and quantile regression, the effect of institutions on financial inclusion is positive and also positively moderate the association between financial development and inclusion. Financial is influenced by other key macroeconomic variables.
Recommendations/value
The study recommends that Governments and policymakers prioritize initiatives aimed at advancing financial development in sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, enhancing the legal and regulatory environment governing financial services, encompassing aspects such as contract enforcement, property rights protection, and corruption reduction, is crucial for sustained financial inclusion.
Implications
Open innovation in the financial sector, particularly in mobile payments, can benefit from the positive impact of financial development on inclusion. Also, open innovation in delivery services can benefit from financial inclusion initiatives, ensuring that individuals and businesses across diverse economic strata have access to efficient and affordable financial delivery services.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing every facet of the business landscape. Early adopter firms have implemented AI for various reasons, but the number one benefit realized is increased innovation (Jyoti & Riley, 2022). Early adopters of AI for new product development (NPD) not only demonstrate that AI finds many applications in NPD, but also offers substantial payoffs. This AI revolution is coming fast, estimated to have a 13–15 year window of adoption, peaking before the end of this decade. This article focuses on AI applications in three target areas in the new product process, where the need for better solutions is high, and the applications for AI show significant benefits. They are: 1) idea generation and concept creation and testing; 2) building a robust business case leading to better “go-to-development” investment decisions; and 3) the design, engineering, development, and testing of the product. AI applications in each of these three target areas are described briefly, along with some in-depth case illustrations of AI at work in NPD, and the benefits achieved by leading firms. These benefits include a remarkable reduction in development and testing times; optimally designed products; better and more appealing new product ideas and concepts; and more effective and productive voice-of-customer studies. Despite the reported benefits of AI in NPD, the adoption rate is quite low, about 13% across firms globally (McKinsey, 2023); thus, AI for NPD was in the “early adopter” stage of the Rogers diffusion of innovation curve by early 2023. Impediments to adoption are outlined, based on numerous studies: the lack of a strong business case; high perceived costs of adoption; the lack of corporate readiness and the right mindset; and risks and ethical issues. High uncertainties remain regarding the adoption of AI in NPD, and many unknowns still exist; thus, numerous opportunities for academic research are identified in the form of research questions begging to be answered. The article ends with a call to action, aimed at both practitioners and academics: AI is the most significant innovation in our lifetime! It's time we all got on board.}

This paper analyses the legal frameworks of selected states, aside from those frameworks at international and EU level. The research indicates that national regulations often concentrate on the testing phase of automated vehicles. Furthermore, these rules frequently require a certain degree of driver involvement, highlighting that some form of human control remains essential. It seems that regulation does not match the speed of technological development or is sometimes somehow unsynchronized with it.}

abstract = {The rise of Online Social Networks (OSNs) continues to surge in today's modern era. Millions of users are attracted and joined various OSNs and use them to perform various activities. People share a massive amount of personal information on OSNs, which has resulted in OSNs becoming a large pool of sensitive data. As OSNs contain a large amount of users' information, they attract malicious users as well. Malicious users exploit profile cloning, Sybil attacks, and other threats to target and misuse sensitive user information. Besides security threats, trust among participants is also a primary concern because many participants may be unknown to each other. Thus, security and trust play a vital role in secure and trustworthy social networking. Current research addresses OSN security and privacy, yet gaps persist in exploring emerging threats (Profile cloning, Sybil attacks) and their countermeasures, along with the crucial aspect of trust management. This paper discusses various security threats and current defense solutions against them. We mainly explore the two most immerging security threats: Profile cloning and Sybil attacks. Besides security threats and their solutions, we also discuss trust management in online social networks. We conduct a comprehensive review of various trust evaluation methods and present our discoveries from the extensive literature survey. Additionally, we provide an overview of potential avenues for future research in this field.}

By using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to build a model that can describe the interaction between Leadership Model, Organizational Citizenship Behavior, and Sales Management in 346 respondents working in various Fast-moving Consumer Goods companies in Indonesia, the present study found the most respondents were from the Special Capital Region of Jakarta (40.7%). It was found that the Sales Director (50.0%) was the most responsible for digital transformation implementation within the sales organization. Most respondents answered that effectiveness in the company's Internal Business Processes was the primary goal of digital transformation (28.1%). Concerning the success parameters of the digital transformation, Business Processes were the prominent expression of successful implementation (19.4%), with Sales Automation (37.4%) as the main activity in their digital transformation. Three hypotheses with the variables of leadership models, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), and sales management control, had proven to affect digital transformation positively. Later, in four hypotheses where sales organization performance was set as the dependent variable, it was found that the leadership model influenced organization performance with digital transformation as a mediator. Finally, the last three hypotheses, with variables of sales management control, organizational citizenship behavior, and leadership model, positively influenced organization performance through digital transformation as a mediating variable. Leaders in organizations who carry out digital transformation must ensure that their organizations can respond to disruptions related to the use of digital technology in order for an organization to achieve proper performance.}

SHHT rely on rational theories of energy use postulating that people will use less energy when the energy cost is higher. The inclusion of AI within SHHT is poised to optimise energy use in the future as the introduction of lower carbon energy sources place new demands on the grid. When SHHT is introduced in the home, however, they become situated in temporal heating practices that are shaped by an interplay of materiality, meanings, and competencies. We report findings from a mixed methods field study involving eleven households utilising an AI-enabled SHHT probe ‘Squid’. Taking a temporal focus throughout, our study contributes a new lens as to why households may not fully engage with SHHT's rational design, given that energy conversation is already embedded in their ongoing socio-material practices with heating. Focusing on the AI-human relation, we articulate the necessity for human agency where heating is involved, whilst also advancing an understanding of the new forms of hidden labour that households incur before they can engage with the AI. Crucially, our research informs the ongoing HCI concern over how humans understand AI, raising the question of who is responsible to assess the appropriateness of AI when the effects of human-AI performance remain opaque. Our findings contribute a new theoretical perspective into the intricate relationship between individuals and AI in the home and raise several new design implications for SHHT.}

abstract = {Background
Digital technologies are present in every phase of a drug lifecycle, from drug design and development to its dispensing and use. However, given the rapid development and implementation of digital solutions, their monitoring, evaluation, and risk assessment are limited and lacking.
Objective
This research is aiming to identify potential errors, quantify and prioritize associated risks in the context of certain technologies used in pharmaceutical care, as well as define corrective measures to improve patient safety and the quality of pharmaceutical care.
Methods
A 10-member multidisciplinary team conducted Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) to identify critical risks, their causes and effects, along with developing corrective measures within the selected digital health components: Telepharmacy, mHealth, Artificial intelligence (AI), and Software infrastructure and systems. Critical risks were determined by calculating risk priority numbers (RPNs) from severity, occurence, and detectability scores.
Results
This study identified 42 risks regarding the 4 components. After calculating RPNs and the threshold RPN (RPN=30), 8 critical risks were identified. Corrective measures were proposed for these failure modes, after which the risks were re-evaluated (RPN sum was reduced from 414 to 156). The risk with the highest RPN value was Internet/identity fraud, while the rest included inadequate and incomplete data entry and management, flawed implementation, human and technology errors, and lack of transparency, personalization and infrastructure. For the critical risks, 42 different causes were recognized on a system, technological and individual level while their effects were discussed in terms of patient safety and business management in pharmacies.
Conclusion
Digitalization of pharmaceutical practice promises greater effectiveness of pharmaceutical care, but in order to achieve this, efforts, resources and initiatives must be directed toward timely identification of problems, appropriate monitoring, and building adequate infrastructure that can support safe implementation of digital tools and services despite the swift development of innovations.}

The research addresses three pivotal questions: (1) Does digitalization authentically ensure sustainability in agriculture? (2) What are the paramount sustainability requirements for digitalization in agriculture? (3) Can SA systems be viably designed to concurrently fulfill digital and sustainable requisites? Employing a two-stage Quality Function Deployment (QFD) framework with the interval-valued 2-Tuple linguistic (IV-2-TL) model, the methodology offers a nuanced analysis of relationships between sustainability-digitalization and SA. Validation through a Turkey-based case study demonstrates the methodology's effectiveness in identifying digital solutions for sustainability needs and prioritizing SA design requirements. This study contributes significantly in three key ways. Firstly, the IV-2-TL-QFD method provides a valuable decision-making framework to assess digitalization-sustainability-SA interconnections ensuring optimal SA design. Secondly, it identifies vital digitalization requirements for addressing sustainability challenges in the QFD framework. Third, a 10-step roadmap guides the transition to SA, portraying digitalization as instrumental in achieving broader sustainability. This study provides profound insights and tools, bridging the gap between digitalization and sustainable agriculture for a more resilient and environmentally responsible future in food production.}

However, these virtual environments characterized by machine-to-machine interactions lacked the presence of humans who are at the center of the next defined industrial revolution, Industry 5.0. The goal is for humans to be actively integrated into these virtual environments called metaverses where interactions with environmental digital assets are possible. To achieve this human-centered industrial metaverse perspective, it is necessary to provide humans with technologies that allow them to reach a more immersive and realistic conception of the production processes. For this purpose, we present in this paper, a framework based on hyperconnectivity where several enabling technologies (e.g., Digital Twins, Virtual Reality, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)) are integrated in order to converge towards the industrial human-centered metaverse. To validate our framework, a demonstrator has been developed enabling the evaluation of the behavior of humans in virtual environments when facing collaborative tasks that require human-to-human interaction. Within the evaluation of this demonstrator, an experiment based on an assembly that requires interaction with an autonomous vehicle has been carried out both in reality and in the virtual world. The results obtained indicate that the avatars’ metaverse performance is closer to reality when individuals have previous experience with VR goggles, even proving, in this case, the effectiveness of metaverse for industrial operators’ training. In addition, the performance of the application has been evaluated with technical parameters and the perception of the users has been analyzed by conducting a survey receiving very positive feedback and results. Therefore, the industrial metaverse, blending cutting-edge tech with a human-centric approach for Industry 5.0, is now a reality.}

The circular transition will ask for the transformation of the companies and the workforce, from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. The set of required skills will be influenced by the circular transition, while the degree of implementation of circular activities will depend on the availability of adequate skills. Nevertheless, the extant literature has not reached a consensus on which competences are required for a circular transition, and few studies have approached this topic at all. This paper presents a systematic literature review to identify and categorize the skills that can facilitate the adoption of circular practices in manufacturing companies. The identified skills were systematically organized within a structured framework extending Porter's Value Chain. Leveraging the literature review's findings, the paper proposes a series of ideal job profiles for circular manufacturing, and it outlines some preliminary education and training paths.

abstract = {The animation industry is currently undergoing significant transformations fueled by technological advancements. Emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, Cloud Computing, the Internet of Things, Virtual and Augmented Reality, and Blockchain are reshaping the animation industry's value chain. This paper explores the impact of Industry 4.0 technologies on various stages of the animation industry's value chain, including conceptualization, pre-production, production, post-production, distribution, and consumption. Through a combination of literature review and semi-structured interviews, the paper identifies key capabilities of Industry 4.0 technologies in the animation industry. Subsequently, experts from different countries were engaged to validate and evaluate these capabilities, scoring them based on their importance and effectiveness in production and marketing activities. Analysis of data from 60 experts resulted in the identification of the most critical capabilities, which were categorized into four groups based on their relation to either the production or marketing of animation products. Furthermore, the analysis of questionnaires enabled the development of four scenarios depicting the potential future trajectories of animation companies based on their adoption of Industry 4.0 capabilities. The paper delves deeper into each scenario, elucidating their underlying factors and characteristics. Ultimately, it is predicted that companies leveraging Industry 4.0 technologies for both production and marketing activities will emerge as the leaders of the animation industry. This paper offers valuable insights into the evolving landscape of the animation sector and provides a roadmap for companies seeking to harness the potential of Industry 4.0 advancements for sustained leadership and success.}

The method integrates Fuzzy The Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (F-DEMATEL) and Fuzzy Logarithm Methodology of Additive Weights (F-LMAW) procedures. Data were collected from 20 experts representing professions such as public relations, advertising, journalism, and design through a 12-question survey. In the analysis, the F-DEMATEL procedure was initially employed to determine attitudes towards AI technologies, followed by the application of the F-LMAW procedure to assess the magnitude of AI's impact on occupational groups. Findings reveal a nuanced stance: while professionals acknowledge the necessity of AI for their work, they are unwilling to accept unemployment due to more advanced AI. This newly identified structure, termed Post-Luddism, highlights concerns over technological unemployment, particularly pronounced in professions like journalism where job prospects are limited and creative thinking is paramount. In other communication fields, the intensive use of technology mitigates fears of AI harm. However, even in journalism, there exists a propensity to perceive AI as detrimental. These insights shed light on communication professionals' apprehensions and attitudes towards AI's effects. Policymakers and stakeholders can leverage this understanding to formulate strategic measures, considering the divergent perspectives among professional groups regarding AI, towards mitigating potential unemployment risks and fostering AI-adaptive strategies.}

This study contributes to ESSs by indicating a set of valid attributes and those attributes are interrelationships in nature. There is major global interest in ESSs due to the pressure to ensure sustainable energy supply sources. An adequate energy source is decisive for ensuring stable economic growth, enhancing social development, and protecting the environment. Nonetheless, in reviewing the energy literature, generating strategic attributes is still lacking, which leads to difficulties for policymakers in building, executing, and assessing energy policies. This study utilizes a hybrid method: text mining, cluster analysis, fuzzy Delphi method, fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory, and entropy weight method. As a result, five aspects and 22 criteria from the data pool are validated. The causal model shows that the energy control system, strategic collaboration and technological capability are the priority. In practice, the effect aspects are waste-to-energy and energy resilience. Although the research trends on ESSs in different regions are quite similar, each continent still has unique concerns such as European countries with distributed energy resources, Asia and Oceania with decarbonization, African countries with new technologies, and Americas with energy planning.}

abstract = {A spillover crisis arises when an external organization’s events create worry, ambiguity, or unfavorable perceptions for another organization. The study shows that organizational response strategies for spillover crises are influenced by an anchoring effect, where competitors’ level of accommodation in their crisis response serves as an anchor point. The difference between accommodative and advocative crisis responses becomes more pronounced when the anchor response has a lower level of accommodation. Additionally, stakeholders’ confidence in an organization’s ability to manage crises can predict its reputation during spillover crises. If an organization chooses to respond with advocacy, it may experience a decline in reputation compared to adopting a competitor's accommodative anchor response due to decreased stakeholder confidence. Conversely, using an accommodative response can result in a higher organizational reputation than following a competitor’s advocative anchor response since it boosts stakeholder confidence. The study highlights the importance of considering situational factors such as competitor responses in the contingency theory of accommodation. Additionally, this study provides evidence that a continuum of public response confidence could be another valuable tool for understanding how crises impact reputation.}

To enhance their sustainability, operational efficiency, and competitiveness, maritime organizations are therefore very keen to build big data analytics capability (BDAC). However, various barriers, mean that only a handful are able to do so. We adopt a mixed-method approach to analyze these barriers. Thematic analysis is used to identify five categories of barriers and 16 individual barriers based on empirical data collected from 26 maritime organizations. These are then prioritized using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), followed by total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) to understand their interrelationships. Finally, cross-impact matrix multiplications applied to classification (MICMAC) is employed to differentiate the role of each barrier based on its driving and dependence power. This paper makes several theoretical contributions. First, China's hierarchical cultural value orientation encourages competition and obedience to rules, resulting in unwillingness to share knowledge, lack of coordination, and lack of error correction mechanisms. These cultural barriers hinder BDAC development. Second, organizational learning category barriers are found to be the most important in impeding BDAC development. This study also raises practitioners' awareness of the need to tackle cultural and organizational learning barriers.}

This perspective calls for the development of data-centric water engineering to tackle water challenges in a changing world. Building on the historical evolution of water engineering from empirical and theoretical paradigms to the current computational paradigm, we argue that a fourth paradigm, i.e., data-centric water engineering, is emerging driven by recent AI advances. Here we define a new framework for data-centric water engineering in which data are transformed into knowledge and insight through a data pipeline powered by AI technologies. It is proposed that data-centric water engineering embraces three principles – data-first, integration and decision making. We envision that the development of data-centric water engineering needs an interdisciplinary research community, a shift in mindset and culture in the academia and water industry, and an ethical and risk framework to guide the development and application of AI. We hope this paper could inspire research and development that will accelerate the paradigm shift towards data-centric water engineering in the water sector and fundamentally transform the planning and management of water infrastructure.}

These investments also fostered additional firm-sponsored training, underscoring the complementarity between investments in digital technologies and training. We then show that the investments helped firms insure their workers against the economic downturn. Firms with additional digital investments retained more of their employees on regular working hours and relied less on short-time work.

abstract = {Background
Few studies have examined patient preferences for telehealth in palliative care after the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. We examined patient preferences for video versus in-person visits and factors contributing to preferences in the postvaccine era.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional survey of patients who were seen at our palliative care clinic between April 2021 and March 2022. Patients were surveyed directly their preference for either video or in-person visits for outpatient palliative care (primary outcome). We also surveyed preferences including convenience, cost, wait time, and perceptions of COVID-19 safety regarding their palliative virtual-video visit. We examined clinical factors associated with preferences with multivariate logistic regression.
Results
About 200 patients completed the survey. 132 (67%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 60%, 74%) preferred virtual-video, while 16 (8%) preferred in-person visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. About 120 (61%, 95%CI: 54%, 68%) preferred virtual-video after the pandemic. Patients perceived virtual-video favorably regarding travel and related costs (179 [91%]), convenience (175 [88%]), and wait time (136 [69%]). Multivariable analysis showed concerns for catching COVID-19 from healthcare providers (odds ratio [OR]: 4.20; 95%CI: 1.24–14.25; P = 0.02) and feeling comfortable with computers or mobile devices (OR: 4.59; 95%CI: 1.02, 20.60; P = 0.047) were significantly associated with preferring virtual-video. Patients who were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (OR: 0.25; 95%CI: 0.09, 0.71) and had increased dypsnea (OR: 0.74; 95%CI: 0.59, 0.93) were less likely to prefer video over in-person.
Conclusion
Patients expressed strong preference for video over in-person visits in the outpatient palliative care setting.}

abstract = {In recent years, the effective governance of artificial intelligence (AI) systems has become a strategic necessity for many nations. Among those nations, Canada is particularly noteworthy: Canada was the first nation to implement a national AI strategy, and more recently, Canada's federal and provincial governments have designed and implemented a wide range of initiatives that attempt to intervene in a variety of potential impacts associated with AI systems. We present a semi-systematic review and synthesis of 84 of those AI governance initiatives. We find that those 84 initiatives predominantly focus on developing programs, policies, and strategic plans to intervene in industry and innovation, technology production and use, AI research, and public administration. Conversely, we find relatively little focus on developing ethics statements or standards, as well as little focus on intervening in social and workforce development services, AI education and training, and digital infrastructure. We suggest three opportunities for researchers and four opportunities for practitioners that, if enacted, would strengthen the overall state of Canadian AI governance. Our study contributes a novel macro-scale synthesis of AI governance initiatives within a national context, as well as practical opportunities for intervening in national AI governance challenges related to evaluation of initiative outcomes, public trust and participation in initiatives, AI impact representation in initiatives, and national unification.}

This study delves into the interplay between personal dispositions and cybersecurity behaviors within organizational settings. It investigates how optimism bias influences attitudes toward cybersecurity and subsequently affects cybersecurity behavior. Additionally, it examines the moderating role of information security awareness in shaping the relationship between attitude and risky cybersecurity behavior.
Design/methodology/approach
Drawing upon extensive research on coping mechanisms and attitude-behavior consistency, we develop a research model that hypothesizes the dynamics of optimism bias, attitude toward cybersecurity, risky cybersecurity behavior, and information security awareness. Survey data are collected from non-IT employees across the United States, and the model is empirically validated using structural equation modeling (SEM).
Findings
This study finds that optimism bias directly contributes to risky cybersecurity behavior and fosters a negative attitude toward cybersecurity. It also reveals that a poor attitude toward cybersecurity further reinforces risky cybersecurity behavior. Additionally, information security awareness is found to negatively moderate the relationship between the attitude toward cybersecurity and risky cybersecurity behavior.
Originality/Value
This study investigates optimism bias in the context of cybersecurity. It enhances the theoretical and empirical understanding of optimism bias in cybersecurity by revealing its influence on cybersecurity attitude and behavior in organizational settings. It also offers managerial insights into the importance of shaping non-IT employees’ cybersecurity attitudes and behavior through risk communication, cybersecurity education, and training.}

Traditional supervision techniques are labour-intensive, intermittent, and prone to errors. Hence, this study statistically evaluates the potential advantages of photogrammetry, sensors, and algorithms to enable continuous automated monitoring. The results of this survey were analysed to compare manual and automated monitoring systems. The outcome shows that the Malaysian construction industry is aware of Automated Monitoring Innovations for Efficient and Safe Construction Practices. The top ranked factor was Photogrammetry which had a relative importance index (RII) of 0.821 for straightforward site monitoring and 0.812 for accelerated 3D BIM modelling. The RII for sensors to track labourers, apparatus, and progress in real time was 0.82, while the RII for hazard anticipation was 0.796. Automation achieved a reduction in fatigue by 0.784, labour intensity by 0.792, and time demands by 0.768, as measured by the RII. A conceptual framework was developed that incorporates measurable improvements in schedules, safety, and quality control. Automated solutions, as opposed to human examinations which are prone to error, provided exhaustive geographical data and ongoing surveillance notwithstanding obstacles pertaining to cost, cybersecurity, privacy, and integration. Construction monitoring must incorporate new technology, strategic change management, data investments, and supporting regulations to increase profitability, safety, and efficiency as competition and complexity increase.}

The ontology associates ‘smartness’ to different building operation domains and assigns their functionalities to agents involved in the flow of data and decision making. It enables control paths to be traced back to specific people, machines, and companies behind smart operations – including those that appear to be ‘external’ to a smart building. Based on Actor-Network Theory (ANT), the ontology connects knowledge from the social sciences to technical knowledge from building design, construction, operation and controls. The need in developing this ontology originates from the limits of conventional design and engineering ontologies, particularly with respect to their unproblematic take on the interplay between different social and technical systems and their neglect to model the varied abilities of stakeholders to exert control over, and benefit from, the technical systems and operations. The proposed ontology addresses these gaps by offering a more realistic and versatile model of inter-agents relationships. It can also highlight points of consented and unconsented data leakage and associated security issues. This knowledge becomes critical for designing and managing increasingly more complex smart building systems.}

The PIML detector is constructed through a customized loss function that integrates the domain knowledge of cyber-attacks into the training process. Additionally, upon detection of attacks, a knowledge-guided extended Kalman filter is developed to provide estimated states for resilient control prior to replacement by redundant sensors. A chemical process example is used to illustrate the application of the proposed PIML-based detection and resilient control methods to handle cyber-attacks.}

However, the specific impact of AI on the process of corporate energy transition and its underlying mechanisms have not been fully explored. This study focuses on A-share listed corporates in Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets in China spanning from 2011 to 2021. Based on corporate annual report information and information from over 200,000 patent application texts, we innovatively construct indicators for corporate energy transition and AI technology application. Furthermore, we empirically investigate the impact of AI technology on corporate energy transition and its potential mechanisms through combining information asymmetry theory and institutional theory. The empirical results indicate that: 1) AI can drive corporate energy transition and the promoting effect of AI collaborative innovation on corporate energy transition should not be ignored. 2) AI can help corporates achieve energy transition through pathways such as mitigating information asymmetry, reducing financing constraints, adjusting sustainable development concepts and practices. 3) The driving effect of AI on corporate energy transition varies depending on the characteristics of different types of corporates, industries, and regions. This study provides strategic guidance and decision support for business managers and policymakers, assisting both corporates and governments in better utilizing AI technology during the social energy transition process to achieve a dual optimization of environmental and economic goals.}

The vision and objectives how DT should be realized on state level is portrayed in well-crafted DT policies. Yet, little is known how governments, as strategic actors, see their role in the DT and how they frame these documents. In this paper, we argue that policymaking about DT is isomorphic in the global context, rather than a differentiator for countries to gain a competitive edge. Using machine learning to analyze a vast text corpus of policy documents, we identify the common repertoire of narratives used by governments from all around the globe to picture their vision of the DT and show that DT policies appear to be almost context-free due to their high similarity.}

To this end, we use the Bibliographic Reference Index (BRI) to examine the prominence of female and male names in the IG references. The BRI is based on an action research process (“pesquisa-ação”), in which authors fill out information about their citation practices. The aim is to promote self-reflection on authors’ selection of references whilst collecting bibliographic data. We applied the BRI to 1113 citations from 35 papers published in the Proceedings of the Brazilian Internet Governance Research Network (REDE) throughout 2017–2021. Results show that male-gendered names were cited more than double the number of times of female-gendered names (47% vs. 20%). To situate these results vis-à-vis global IG, we analyze the gender gap in the curriculum of IG schools and courses, by applying the index to an Internet Governance Forum compilation of 22 IG syllabi and course programs, comprising 96 references and the names of 217 IG experts worldwide. Results show that female names authored only 19% of the syllabi readings and materials featured vs. 29% by men. Also, the gender rate among experts is 63% vs. 37% in favor of men. Based on the structural gender inequalities that we have found in global and local IG contexts, we recommend interventions to increase the conscious engagement with bibliography and syllabus preparation on two fronts: 1) we recommend the application of the BRI to IG syllabi and course programs to monitor and reduce the gender gap; and 2) we provide a citation diversity statement that IG scholars can add to their publications in order to promote self-reflection about their knowledge production and add transparency to the politics of citation in IG.}

The article proposes a mixed approach based on an extensive literature review and the application of the association rules technique. Specifically, the study collected 2496 sustainable business practices supported by 11 digital technologies within 42 business processes for the achievement of the 17 SDGs. Then, this paper employed the Apriori algorithm to intercept the main combinations between digital technologies, business processes, and SDGs. The results suggest that artificial intelligence, geospatial technologies, blockchain, Internet of Things, and 3D printing can contribute to the achievement of SDGs 6,7, 12, and 13 in different business processes. The study provides several implications for managers and policymakers to direct their business strategy and technological choices in the adoption of digital technologies geared toward achieving the SDGs.}

abstract = {As one of popular destinations in Indonesia for tourism, Lombok Island has been confronted with an overgeneration of solid waste recently. About 600 metric ton (Mt) of the waste is generated daily with 40 % of it as non-biodegradable waste. Amidst the challenges of climate change and the need for decarbonization, this case-study investigates various challenges in strengthening synergies between waste management and climate change mitigation in Lombok, while exploring opportunities to accelerate decarbonization in the waste sector through circular-economy digitalization. Case study of digitalization-based waste recycling in Hainan Island (China) are presented as a model for Lombok to replicate its successful story on how digital technologies contribute to sustainability with respect to efficiency and waste circularity. To obtain relevant data, the research questions cover: How did both Hainan and Lombok Islands deal with the challenges and opportunities associated with digitalization-based circular economy (CE)? What are the implications of digitalization-based waste recycling on the society and economy? It was found that digital revolution has affected all sectors including the waste sector in Hainan. As digitalization has expanded in all sectors, this creates opportunities to optimize waste recycling and decrease GHG emissions, while driving decarbonization across the economy. About 90 % of waste avoidance was attained in Hainan when using digitalization for waste recycling. CE strategies also complement decarbonization to reduce GHG emission from material production through waste recycling, while minimizing its direct emission from local landfills. While the digitalization-based approach is promising for improving waste management in Lombok, its appropriateness and feasibility depend on the Island's socio-economic conditions and digital readiness. The findings underline the importance of integrating digital solutions into local waste management and calls for collaboration among policymakers, stakeholders, and communities to realize the potential of circular-economy digitalization in accelerating decarbonization. By adopting digital opportunities in the waste sector based on China's experiences, Indonesia could accelerate decarbonization pathways in waste sector to accomplish its net-zero emission goals by 2060.}

abstract = {Advanced rail transit systems (ARTS), including high-speed rail and maglev trains, provide enhanced transportation options to meet the growing demand for efficient transportation systems. However, they present unique challenges in maintaining the safety and performance of their infrastructures. Structural health monitoring (SHM) has emerged as an essential practice to forestall the potential consequences of structural defects in ARTS. Recently, digital twins and digital shadows have been successfully employed in various industries to monitor the state of physical systems. However, their application for structural health monitoring in ARTS remains largely unexplored. Hence, this article explores the potential of digital twins and digital shadows, in improving structural health monitoring in ARTS. Due to the digital twins’ ability to bi-directional communication between a real system and its virtual replica, this article presents a comprehensive literature survey on their enablers and capabilities. Meanwhile, a framework for digital twins-based monitoring in ARTS is also proposed. The key distinctions and benefits of digital twins over other Industry 4.0 digital representation concepts, such as real-time monitoring, optimization, prediction, simulation, and decision-making, are identified. The paper highlights the significant opportunities that digital twins, especially, can offer to improve health monitoring. Similarly, limitations and bottlenecks that must be tackled in future research for implementations are also acknowledged. Finally, harnessing the power of digital twins can catalyze a transformative shift in ARTS, leading to more effective monitoring, enhanced safety, and improved performance.}

This situation has led to the implementing new technologies and tools to increase the sector's added value. One of the significant trends has been digital transformation, adopting technological methodologies such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), Drones, Automation, Apps, the Internet of Things, and Big Data. Implementing these technologies has improved processes; however, this change process has been slow and gradual and has not generated radical transformations. One of the most significant problems is the resistance to change at the organizational level. Therefore, the primary goal of this research is to analyze the interaction between organizational structure and digital transformation; this relationship could substantially improve construction services and products. A survey was designed and distributed to companies in the Colombian construction sector, using 13 variables that impact digital transformation and organizational structures. Three hundred thirty-two valid responses were collected; they were analyzed using descriptive statistics, factorial analysis, and logistic regressions. The results show that the main aspects impacting the digital transformation processes are Employee Training and Development, Promotion Opportunities, Business Strategy, Leadership Styles, Cloud Services, and Integrated Organizational Innovation. Companies should understand the advantages of digital transformation and the necessary changes to reach an optimal organizational structure; these improvements will directly relate to improving construction services and products.}

abstract = {Farm systems around the world have become less complex, dominated by monocultures, but at the same time much more complicated due to the increasing demands from society, leading to ever increasing compliance and regulatory requirements. Digital technologies have the potential to help alleviate such complications by virtue of their capacity to handle large quantities of information and by automating tasks. However, the opposite seems to be happening. The continuous proliferation of technologies being marketed to farmers adds to the complexity of farming. Farmers are feeling overwhelmed by the abundance of alternative technologies and are complaining about a lack of compatibility between them. We took the view that all the digital elements on farm need to be considered as a system, rather than looking at each component in isolation. We call such system the “digital layer” of a farm. Taking an engineering approach, we started by cataloguing the tasks that a generic farmer would routinely perform. We described 178 farm tasks, including strategic (11), operational (130) and reporting (37) tasks. This catalogue was organized in the form of an ontology, and guided us to develop a systematic description of the functional requirements of the digital layer. The inventory of functional requirements is a critical element in the design of the digital layer. We conducted a network analysis considering the data interdependencies between tasks, and observed a relatively high level of interconnectivity between tasks. This explains why digital technologies developed in isolation are struggling with interoperability issues, and, at least in part the reasons for farmers’ frustrations. This led us to conclude that the farm digital layer needs to be holistically designed, delivered, and supported, to support farm tasks coherently. This would require a much higher degree of coordination than we currently observe in the agri-tech sector, and possibly the need for central coordination entities.}

Our approach is based on the mathematical modeling to establish a controlled fractional network-based SIRS malware propagation model that better describes the attacking behavior of malicious objects on Wireless Sensor Network. After that, we point out some qualitative properties of the proposed network-based SIRS malware propagation model such as the existence of positively invariant set, backward bifurcation and asymptotic behavior. Especially, in order to study the model's stability, we evaluate an epidemiological threshold value R0, namely basic reproductive ratio, which ensures the existence of at least one endemic equilibrium P⁎ and the local asymptotic stability of malware-free equilibrium P0. As a consequence of theoretical result, the malware-free equilibrium P0 is unstable when R0>1 and hence, the rest of this paper is to address a stabilization problem for the proposed controlled network-based model and establish some sufficient conditions related to linear matrix inequalities and positive definite matrices. Finally, we illustrate the obtained theoretical results by a computational example.}

Despite the accelerated growth of AI technologies, knowledge of the implementation of AI by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remains underexplored. Thus, this study seeks to examine how manufacturing SMEs orchestrate resources for AI implementation. Building on the resource orchestration (RO) theory and recent work on AI implementation, we investigate multiple case studies involving manufacturing SMEs in Sweden operating in the packaging, plastic, and metal sectors. Our findings indicate that SMEs structure a portfolio based on acquiring and accumulating AI resources. AI resources are bundled into learning and governance capabilities to leverage configurations for AI implementation. Through a dynamic process of AI resource orchestration, SMEs effectively leverage AI resources and capabilities by mobilising technologies, coordinating manufacturing processes, and empowering skilled people. This research contributes to existing practice and the academic literature on AI implementation, highlighting how SMEs orchestrate AI resources and capabilities to drive an organisation’s digital transformation whilst creating a competitive advantage.}

abstract = {Unlike linear supply chains, Circular Supply Chains (CSCs) require return flows able to capture additional value and involving different stakeholders. The successful interaction of Circular Economy and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) towards a circular, efficient, and competitive transition of current supply chains is unveiled by both current state of theory and practice. Notwithstanding literature’s multiple attempts to flank supply chains in this complex shift, the several theoretical frameworks proposed by academics are still not fully capable of bridging linear supply chains to their transitions towards circularity due to a lack of systemic, company-specific, and practical approaches. In addition, practical impediments, risks and treats hindering CSCs development are still under-investigated and, therefore, further research is required in this domain. To address these gaps, this paper aims to develop and propose a model able to support companies in approaching the transition towards CSCs, also embedding guidelines and recommendations in the different steps of this path. The model has been conceptualized based on five I4.0-driven CSCs categories recently proposed through a systematization of the knowledge extant in literature (I4.0 enabling technologies, performance tools and indicators, challenges and barriers, business models and strategies, best practices) and on a gap analysis performed in literature to unveil theoretical gaps and practical barriers in the CSC domain. Finally, the model has been refined and validated by ten selected academic experts through an online asynchronous survey, leading to the detection of seven recurrent practical barriers (lack of tax policies and incentives, weak environmental laws and regulations, limited financial resources and support, high investments and implementation costs, lack of coordination and collaboration among the SC members, lack of technological resources and infrastructures, lack of compatibility and integration of technical platforms) as the most critical in the CSC transition. The model, structured in four main phases (conceptualization, design, implementation and measurement) and grounded on the five categories derived from the literature, addresses each of the steps of the CSC transition according to circular strategies and optimal digital technologies. Managerial implications emerge from the systematization and categorization of methods, approaches and warnings operated in the model proposed. The model turns to be capable of enhancing the realization of the entire CSC process in a digital context, acting against the CSC theoretical gaps and practical barriers detected in the gap analysis conducted in this research.}

This article delves into the dynamic realm of microgrids, emphasizing their indispensable role in addressing today's energy needs while navigating the hazards of pollution. Microgrid operations are intricately shaped by a web of constraints, categorized into two essential domains: those inherent to the microgrid itself and those dictated by the external environment. These constraints, stemming from component limitations, environmental factors, and grid connections, exert substantial influence over the microgrid's operational capabilities. Of particular significance is the three-tiered control framework, encompassing primary, secondary, and energy management controls. This framework guarantees the microgrid's optimal function, regulating power quality, frequency, and voltage within predefined parameters. Central to these operations is the energy management control, the third tier, which warrants in-depth exploration. This facet unveils the art of fine-tuning parameters within the microgrid's components, seamlessly connecting them with their surroundings to streamline energy flow and safeguard uninterrupted operation. In essence, this article scrutinizes the intricate interplay between microgrid constraints and energy management parameters, illuminating how the nuanced adjustment of these parameters is instrumental in achieving the dual objectives of cost reduction and Carbon Dioxide emission minimization, thereby shaping a more sustainable and eco-conscious energy landscape. This study investigates microgrid dynamics, focusing on the nuanced interplay between constraints and energy management for cost reduction and Carbon Dioxide minimization.

Employing a deductive-inductive approach, an exhaustive literature review combined with an in-depth, multiple case study analysis of sixteen firms provides rich insights into the digital transformation journey. Findings reveal technology, data, human capital, processes, and organization structure as key enablers alongside their critical, complementary roles for transformation. Cross-case analysis identified instances of the DT framework, uncovering three archetypes: process efficiency, responsiveness, and strategic agility. Each archetype exhibits distinct socio-technical enabler configurations and improvements to business processes, resulting in unique operational capabilities and value generation. This research provides actionable guidance for managers in leveraging socio-technical enablers to achieve successful digital transformation. It underscores the need for tailored strategies, recognizing that a one-size-fits-all approach is inadequate. Managers must strategically select desired values and develop the necessary socio-technical system components, processes, and operational capabilities to attain them.

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics research and implementation emerged in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry to positively impact project efficiency and effectiveness concerns such as safety, productivity, and quality. This shift, however, warrants the need for ethical considerations of AI and robotics adoption due to its potential negative impacts on aspects such as job security, safety, and privacy. Nevertheless, this did not receive sufficient attention, particularly within the academic community. This research systematically reviews AI and robotics research through the lens of ethics in the AEC community for the past five years. It identifies nine key ethical issues namely job loss, data privacy, data security, data transparency, decision-making conflict, acceptance and trust, reliability and safety, fear of surveillance, and liability, by summarizing existing literature and filtering it further based on its AEC relevance. Furthermore, thirteen research topics along the process were identified based on existing AEC studies that had direct relevance to the theme of ethics in general and their parallels are further discussed. Finally, the current challenges and knowledge gaps are discussed and seven specific future research directions are recommended. This study not only signifies more stakeholder awareness of this important topic but also provides imminent steps towards safer and more efficient realization.}

Recognizing a gap in the literature for constructs that encapsulate supply chain resilience from an immune system perspective, this article introduces conceptual and formal models drawing from molecular biology and immunology. Our models reflect the dual nature of supply chain resilience as a composition of preparedness and recovery, interpreted through the primary components of immune systems—innate and adaptive immunities. We discuss how certain analogies between immune and supply chain systems, along with dissimilarities, can be leveraged to enhance supply chain resilience. An immune system-inspired mechanism for supply chain resilience is proposed using a combination of innate and adaptive responses and complemented by the principles of diversity and redundancy. Finally, the article outlines potential research areas within the domain of supply chain resilience (e.g., data-driven analytics, viability, ripple effect, complexity analysis, and uncertainty modeling) that could benefit from the application of the immune system perspective, thereby contributing to and broadening the scope of current scholarly literature.}

The empirical results show that (1) digitalization significantly curtails risk-taking on the balance sheet, while concurrently escalating off-balance sheet risk exposure; (2) digitalization diminishes on-balance sheet risk by lessening distortions in competition due to government guarantees, manifested as a competition effect of on-balance sheet guarantee; (3) digitalization increases the upper limit of expected returns on bank financial products, thereby elevating off-balance sheet risk-taking, evident as an off-balance sheet price competition effect; (4) bank digitalization has a more obvious boosting effect on off-balance sheet risk-taking of banks with a longer average maturiy of wealth management products. This paper enriches the measurement of the digitalization of banks and provides a reference for banks to deepen digital applications and strengthen risk management, which has important practical significance.}

abstract = {Open government data (OGD) has great potential to promote economic growth, stimulate innovation, and improve service efficiency. However, as more and more private information is collected by government information systems, private data become increasingly vulnerable. Thus, governments must monitor the privacy risks of OGD. The focus of this study is to identify privacy risk factors in the process of developing OGD. Using a mixed-method design, we developed a privacy risk identification framework based on evidence from China. According to the results of qualitative interviews, the privacy risk identification framework mainly includes five risk dimensions: data risk, institutional risk, technical risk, structural risk, and behavioral risk. We identified 17 risk factors under these five dimensions. We further developed the measurement items for each risk factor and verified the indicator framework through quantitative methods. Our research provides a theoretical basis for identifying the privacy risks in OGD, supporting governments in discovering and dealing with them accordingly. Future research can continuously explore potential privacy risks arising from merging technologies such as generative artificial intelligence when applied to OGD.}
