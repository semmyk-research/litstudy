abstract = {Historically, the U.S. was the first country to formally introduce regulations that require a management system to safeguard processing plants following a series of chemical release incidents having catastrophic consequences. The issuing regulatory entity, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enforces the regulations for Process Safety Management (PSM) of facilities handling highly hazardous chemicals. This management system contains 14 elements that are to be incorporated over a covered facility's lifecycle. Other countries followed with similar management system requirements for process safety. Digitalization of the process industry is evident in nearly every system of chemical manufacturing. Digital controls and data communications as applied to processing plants continue to grow in capability as well as complexity. Advances in digital technologies have also affected the way PSM systems are applied to these facilities. While digitalization used in the PSM elements offers significant advantages with respect to effectiveness and efficiency, there are also disadvantages. These will be described for some of the elements in this chapter, along with a few practical applications. At the chapter's end, a few recent journal articles that have been briefly reviewed are summarized. These articles discuss future advanced safety management aspects, e.g., emphasizing the importance of digital twin technique for safe human-machine interaction, and how digitalization will support improvements in process safety by means of many different mechanisms.}

abstract = {Today, the built environment is designed, built, and managed using digital technology, making it increasingly exposed to cyber security risks. Cybersecurity is a general topic, and the construction sector has been borrowing general solutions and frameworks. However, the construction industry is specific and needs a specialized framework that would assist in understanding and managing cybersecurity. We have studied general cybersecurity frameworks, cybersecurity standards, research literature, and first principles of systems theory and process engineering. Drawing from that, we developed an original framework that identifies three kinds of wrongful activities: stealing, lying, and harming. It identifies four elements that can be affected by wrongful activities: information asset, material asset, person, and system. It defines cybersecurity as the absence of the three wrongs across the four kinds of elements. The framework is construction-specific, and as such, a useful tool for senior management to understand security problems and organize security processes. It can lead to better standardization and also helps the researchers to structure future work on the topic. The latter should be concentrated in areas where construction was found to be different: the dynamic and overlapping process and organizational boundaries in the design stage, the exposed shared design information, and the vulnerability of control information of the built environment, particularly in critical infrastructures.}

The aim is to build a conceptual framework to consolidate a common view on this growing yet fragmented issue by integrating a wide range of findings from the literature. The study adopts a systematic literature review approach to systematize such knowledge in a singular and consolidated perspective on Industry 4.0 technologies and work. The study analyzes 80 papers in this field and investigates how different Industry 4.0 technologies are related to workers’ manufacturing activities. Eight main manufacturing activities were considered to frame the analysis: assembly, maintenance, training, quality control, movement, machine operation, product and process design, and production planning and control. Eight worker capabilities that Industry 4.0 technologies can enhance were also considered: super-strength capability, augmented capability, virtual capability, healthy capability, smart capability, collaborative, social capability, analytical capability. Based on these 80 papers, this paper conceptualizes Smart Working-related technologies for Operators 4.0 and shows their benefits and limitations as described in the literature. The study shows how these manufacturing activities and worker capabilities can be supported by Industry 4.0 technologies, which is useful for future research and the design of operational processes in the Industry 4.0 context.}

However, there are limitations in terms of responding to penetrations, and the existing EOPs are insufficient for responding to intentional disruptions. In this study, we focus on manipulative attacks on process data. Based on an analysis of the related attack vectors and possible attack scenarios, we adopt the Kalman filter to detect process anomalies that can be caused by manipulations of process data. To compensate for these manipulations and secure MCR operators' situational awareness, we modify the Kalman filter such that it can filter out the effects of the manipulations adaptively. A case study was conducted using a hardware-in-the-loop system. The results indicated that the developed method can be used to verify whether the displayed safety-related state data are reliable and to implement the required safety response actions.}

The connected dimension of CAV provides for the vehicle to communicate with other vehicles and local infrastructure to operate in a safe manner. Yet, it is this communication of data and operation through software which causes potential problems in the event of the software suffering from unlawful modification (hacking). The consequences of a CAV being hacked could result in its features being compromised resulting in accidents, damage, financial loss, deaths and personal injury. It is also likely that hacking will affect fleets of vehicles operating on the same software version rather than individual vehicles. In this paper we argue there is a need for a strategy to determine how responsibility for the damage and loss caused following the mass hacking of CAVs is to be apportioned. This discussion is presently missing in the evolving literature on CAV maturity and we conclude that a national compensatory body offering a guarantee fund from which victims may seek redress would provide the most appropriate solution for all stakeholders.}

The rising interest in the integration of digital advanced manufacturing and production systems in the Industry 4.0 context is one of the main factors in the introduction of Additive Manufacturing (AM). The novel technology might change the way firms operate, and the way they interact with consumers, opening new horizons for an improved profit margin and more sustainable business models. The research presented a comprehensive review on the potent role of AM in adhering to customers’ complicated and unique needs using various technologies and techniques, as it discussed the role of AM in introducing new business models that increase the business competitiveness and profitability through an optimisation of production processes. In addition, AM is grasping with innovative solutions varying from waste reduction to shorter supply chains to longer products lifecycle, incentivising firms to adopt it for the economies realised on materials, energy, and costs. Notwithstanding, AM implementation is still in its infancy and faces technical challenges of capability, IT integration, and outcomes.
Design/Methodology/approach
This research is based on a quantitative approach that was administered online by means of a highly structured online survey, which aim was to collect primary data that fills the gaps of the research hypotheses due to the lacking nature of research papers exploring them. Therefore, the literature review was a paramount phase in acquiring empirical knowledge about the problem background and concept boundaries that shaped the topic's core objectives and research questions from the lacking nature of explored areas.
Findings

In this scenario, artificial intelligence (AI) is starting to play a major role in the energy market. Recognizing the importance of AI, this study was conducted on seven different energetics systems and their variety of applications, including: i) electricity production; ii) power delivery; iii) electric distribution networks; iv) energy storage; v) energy saving, new energy materials, and devices; vi) energy efficiency and nanotechnology; and vii) energy policy, and economics. The main drivers are the four key techniques used in current AI technologies, including: i) fuzzy logic systems; ii) artificial neural networks; iii) genetic algorithms; and iv) expert systems. In developed countries, the power industry has started using AI to connect with smart meters, smart grids, and the Internet of Things devices. These AI technologies will lead to the improvement of efficiency, energy management, transparency, and the usage of renewable energies. In recent decades/years, new AI technology has brought significant improvements to how power system devices monitor data, communicate with the system, analyze input–output, and display data in unprecedented ways. New applications in the energy system become feasible when these new AI developments are incorporated into the energy industry. But on the contrary, much more investment is needed in global research into AI and data-driven models. In terms of power supply, AI can help utilities provide customers with renewable and affordable electricity from complex sources in a secure manner, while at the same time providing these customers with the opportunity to use their own energy more efficiently. Moreover, policy recommendations, research opportunities, and how industry 4.0 will improve sustainability have been briefly described.}

Countries wield considerable technology adoption power and their adoption activities can be leveraged to achieve social, economic, and environmental goals by endorsing specific technologies. To encourage greater adoption, it is vital to determine the predictors of technology adoption to design effective promotion policies, accomplished through the modification of Diffusion of Innovation theory. While there is substantial research in individual consumer adoption behavior, less is known about country level factors that impact technology adoption. To overcome these gaps in the research, we undertook an investigative study to better understand the predictors of a country's technology adoption rate. We use a random effects panel model to predict technology adoption factors for a sample of 15 countries over the period of 2010–2019 using secondary datasets. We identify a statistically significant effect of competitiveness, cybersecurity, ease of doing business, and the level of political stability/non-violence and terrorism. We thus posit that a country that is highly competitive, has enhanced cybersecurity, is easy to do business in, and has a low level of political violence and terrorism adopts new technologies more readily than others.}

This is a strategic priority of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), public policies and global initiatives. The operability and functionality of critical infrastructure are continuously challenged by multiple stressors, increasing demands and ageing, whilst their interconnectedness and dependencies pose additional challenges. Emerging and disruptive digital technologies have the potential to enhance climate resilience of critical infrastructure, by providing rapid and accurate assessment of asset condition and support decision-making and adaptation. In this pursuit, it is imperative to adopt multidisciplinary roadmaps and deploy computational, communication and other digital technologies, tools and monitoring systems. Nevertheless, the potential of these emerging technologies remains largely unexploited, as there is a lack of consensus, integrated approaches and legislation in support of their use. In this perspective paper, we discuss the main challenges and enablers of climate-resilient infrastructure and we identify how available roadmaps, tools and emerging digital technologies, e.g. Internet of Things, digital twins, point clouds, Artificial Intelligence, Building Information Modelling, can be placed at the service of a safer world. We show how digital technologies will lead to infrastructure of enhanced resilience, by delivering efficient and reliable decision-making, in a proactive and/or reactive manner, prior, during and after hazard occurrences. In this respect, we discuss how emerging technologies significantly reduce the uncertainties in all phases of infrastructure resilience evaluations. Thus, building climate-resilient infrastructure, aided by digital technologies, will underpin critical activities globally, contribute to Net Zero target and hence safeguard our societies and economies. To achieve this we set an agenda, which is aligned with the relevant SDGs and highlights the urgent need to deliver holistic and inclusive standards and legislation, supported by coordinated alliances, to fully utilise emerging digital technologies.}

Digitalization brings the opportunity to generate and collect digital operational data and reduce human operation for effective process monitoring and control for safety assurance. The system's capability of processing massive data becomes essential for process safety. Meanwhile, digitalization increases the complexity of human-computer interaction and consequently leads to new research and practical problems.

abstract = {A system paradigm is a typical pattern or model of enterprise architectures (EAs) that describes constitutive system elements and their relations in achieving missions and goals of enterprises. A well-defined system paradigm and EA help enterprises in adopting appropriate manufacturing resources and technologies, optimizing plans, schedules, and controls of production lines, and coping with complexity, changes, and uncertainties of business processes cost-effectively. It is understandable that a system paradigm should be evolved along with the availability and advancement of advanced manufacturing technologies; on the other hand, new system paradigms are mostly inspired by some successful manufacturing applications of new information technologies (ITs). One of the recently developed system paradigms is Digital Manufacturing (DM) where Digital Twin (DT-I) is used to describe the interactions of virtual and physical entities. This paper discusses the concepts of DM and DT-I and rationalizes the relations of DM and DT-I; in particular, the origin and evolution of DT-I are explored in details to identify its limitations to be used as an EA for DM. It is our finding that existing IT concepts show their limitations in supporting smooth transitions when systems have to be reconfigured in dealing with long-term changes in Sustainable Manufacturing, and this is evidenced by the fact of the trend of the shortened lifespans of modern enterprises even with the aids of rapidly developed digital technologies in decades. To overcome these limitations, a new concept so called Digital Triad (DT-II) is coined and the Internet of Digital Triad Things (IoDTT) is proposed as an information integration (II) solution for digital manufacturing enterprises, and their application is illustrated through a reconfigurable robotic system example. The rationales and significances of DT-II and IoDTT as well as future research directions of DM are summarized as a conclusion.}

abstract = {As a proactive reaction to current ineffective collaboration strategies, this study sought to combine the capabilities of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in the Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA) method with mass customisation into a framework that enables customers to participate in the offsite construction configuration process. This approach engenders greater customer satisfaction whilst increasing production and construction efficiency. A model capable of facilitating the use of construction information in the proposed framework was developed to implement the proposed framework into practice. Combining the BIM model within the framework provides all project stakeholders with prerequisite information needed for a building's configuration. This collaborative process utilises an algorithmic composition in which the current assembly information in both the BIM model and framework is used as a controlling factor in the configuration process. The parametric environment of Revit and the algorithmic environment of the Dynamo plugin were used to realise the proposed framework (as a proof of concept).}

The official app stores (google, IOS, Microsoft, Amazon) provide a platform for hosting, publishing, distributing, and managing the mobile applications developed by companies and individuals. This mobile application ecosystem could be used to distribute the malicious apps which are specifically designed to track behavior of users, spy on the activities of users, and could be a threat to the privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of the users. In this paper, we present a novel approach called DEEPSEL (Deep Feature Selection), a deep learning-based method for the identification of malware and malicious codes within android applications. DEEPSEL uses a set of features to characterize the behavior of android applications and classify them as legitimate and malicious. The main contribution is characterized by the usage of particle swarm optimization for performing feature selection. We evaluated our approach on a public malware data-set which is composed of samples collected from 39 unique malware families. Our results show that the proposed method can achieve very good results with an accuracy of around 83.6% and an F-measure of around 82.5%.}

While there is growing research interest in these areas, examining the role of human element in the new smart shipping context is largely neglected. Through a systematic literature review, this paper aims to explore the multi-dimensional impact of autonomous shipping technology resulting from the application of Industry 4.0 and future industrial revolutions on seafarers. The impacts include the changing role of seafarers on-board and the strategies required to engage seafarers in their transition from traditional shipping to autonomous and smart shipping. The paper concludes that Industry 4.0 is being challenged for its shortfall in recognition of the importance of human role and its intelligence in the expected current industrial revolution. As a result, there is a demand to look further and beyond Industry 4.0 by introducing the next generation of industrial revolution, namely Industry 5.0. This paper suggests that the impact of this revolution in the maritime industry can be defined by concepts such as Maritime 5.0, Shipping 5.0, Seafarer 5.0, Maritime Education and Training 5.0 (MET 5.0).}

Technology-enhanced audits (TEA) offer a potential solution to supplier audit problems by enabling enhanced analytical, visualization, modeling, and predictive capabilities. This paper explores the potential of Industry 4.0 practices in enhancing supplier audit authenticity and efficacy, as well as reducing supplier monitoring costs. The application of Industry 4.0 in supplier auditing is still in its infancy. Therefore, this paper adopts an exploratory approach building on an extensive review of the literature. The paper builds upon an inductive-deductive approach to explore how the individual technologies underlying Industry 4.0 can be leveraged to enhance supplier audits. Based on insights from the literature, the paper develops propositions outlining the role of Industry 4.0 in supplier audit authenticity, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness. The paper builds arguments against the backdrop of traditional audits' limitations and illustrates how TEA can overcome many of these limitations. TEA can enhance the authenticity and efficacy of supplier audits, while also reducing supplier monitoring costs. TEA are most effective in an Industry 4.0 environment where the use of technologies is supported with governance structures. The application of Industry 4.0 can make supplier audits more transparent and value-adding, benefiting both the buyer and supplier. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are explored. Suppliers can leverage TEA to create opportunities for strategic differentiation, enhance transparency and trust, and stand out from those who view audits solely as a cost. Buyers can use TEA to enhance audit efficacy, enhance insights into supplier operations, cut monitoring costs, and improve their competitiveness. TEA is a new generation of supplier auditing that has the potential to bring fundamental changes to current auditing models and make audits genuine, authentic, prospective, and insightful while building on Industry 4.0 principles.}

However, the focus of the debate has been mostly on game studies and human-computer interaction (HCI). Even though games are increasingly being supplied as services to customers, few academic works have linked game studies to the service or marketing literature (Dikcius and Urbonavicius, 2020; Dukembay and Zhaksylyk, 2019). This paper presents an examination of the emerging trends of gamification and e-learning for young learners. The first section presents a text-based cluster bibliometric analysis based on 222 qualified articles published between 2015 and 2020. We conducted this analysis to identify the most prominent themes in the literature through cluster identification via the VOS viewer software. As the themes were found to be interlinked, the second section presents a systematic literature review based on a bibliometric analysis performed using the PRISMA method on 32 qualified articles. The findings highlighted the four major future research themes of personalization, game elements, learner styles, and learner engagement. Finally, we provide a future research agenda based on the theory, characteristics, context, and methodology (TCCM) framework. Our findings offer key insights aimed at enabling actors in education policy making and gamification-based software companies and agencies to identify the gamification techniques best suited for e-learning.}

These are dreaded indicators that had been long fingered as principal problems that would envelop the world around 2050 when the global population is estimated to hit 9 billion. Global organizations such as the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), Heifer International, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, etc., have consistently demonstrated strategies that would help eradicate global hunger by 2030. As sustained efforts are directed at thousands of remarkable projects worldwide, it is important to reemphasize that such projects could only be realized through insights derived from meaningful information and knowledge resources. In agriculture, there has been a rapid rise of late in the modernization and deployment of automated agricultural information systems (agricultural databases, smart systems, Internet of Things (IoT) systems, agribots, etc.) to aid planning, production, and distribution processes. Interestingly, most of these global knowledge and information bases are in the cloud and other Internet infrastructure. The trend in global information storage has sensitive information (government policies, orders, decisions, plans, etc., on agriculture and food production) from public and private domains residing on one or more cyberinfrastructures. That leads to an attendant risk of sabotage and breaches. This is due to the ever-growing attempts on critical infrastructure worldwide by apologists, cyberterrorists, and cybercriminals. This could result in project failures, irrecoverable losses, and governance and policy failures, to name a few. This chapter presents a detailed account of the various cyberthreats, especially cyberespionage and cyberterrorism that are capable of sabotaging the collective strategies of organizations and entities pursuing sustainable food security. In this chapter, we discuss motivations, ideologies, and strategies behind cyberespionage against agriculture and related platforms; the architecture, categorization, propagation, and attack methods; the socioeconomic implications of these attacks; countermeasures; and legal frameworks.}

This question arises overtly amidst a pandemic, but it also lurks behind the widespread diffusion of smart energy systems throughout the world and the increased use of smart meters in those systems. The extent to which forms of monitoring, disciplining and sanctioning of energy behavior and practices could come to reality is thus an important question to consider. This article does so using the ideas of Michel Foucault, together with research on smart energy systems and current trends in energy policy.

However, what the implementation stages for Industry 4.0 in SMEs should be as well as the respective resources for achieving the next stage are scarcely understood. In response, this paper proposes a framework using a resource-based review for Industry 4.0 implementation according to the stage of development in SMEs, created between researchers, policy makers, and 354 manufacturing SMEs in the province of Gipuzkoa (Basque Country, Spain). The paper applies a mixed-method approach, combining qualitative (interviews) and quantitative elements (survey data). The results are used to develop a model with four stages of SMEs that are characterized by having distinct preconditions and conditions for Industry 4.0. Thereupon, the required measures to achieve the next stage of Industry 4.0 implementation are derived. This highlights Industry 4.0 for SMEs as a process with different stages toward achieving sustainable competitive advantage and offering insight into how the different resources operate. The high importance and advanced position regarding industrial value creation and SMEs in Gipuzkoa allows to generalize and transfer the findings to other European regions.}

Inspired by the need to better understand their idiosyncrasies, particular needs and implications, this paper aims to scrutinise current issues and concerns about digital transformation in the remanufacturing systems. In particular, the paper reviews the extant literature to observe: (1) how the I4.0 technologies have so far been used in remanufacturing and (2) the benefits and risks that need to be considered by remanufacturers when adopting the I4.0 technologies. We have elucidated the significance of our findings and subsequently synthesised our thoughts into eight propositions that demystify the mechanisms of how the I4.0 technologies can bring potential benefits when used by remanufacturers to accomplish a portfolio of remanufacturing tasks, and the risks they need to be aware of. This articulation represents contributions to knowledge as it will set out the underpinning of the future human-technology collaboration, which is key in the I4.0 realm.}

Previous studies on anomaly detection have examined mainly abnormalities that translate into fraud, such as fraudulent credit card transactions or fraud in insurance systems. However, anomalies represent irregularities in system patterns data, which may arise from deviations, adulterations or inconsistencies. Further, its study encompasses not only fraud, but also any behavioural abnormalities that signal risks. This paper proposes a literature review of methods and techniques to detect anomalies on diverse financial systems using a five-step technique. In our proposed method, we created a classification framework using codes to systematize the main techniques and knowledge on the subject, in addition to identifying research opportunities. Furthermore, the statistical results show several research gaps, among which three main ones should be explored for developing this area: a common database, tests with different dimensional sizes of data and indicators of the detection models' effectiveness. Therefore, the proposed framework is pertinent to comprehending an existing scientific knowledge base and signals important gaps for a research agenda considering the topic of anomalies in financial systems.}

abstract = {This chapter reflects on the current state and provides future directions of the growing field of food engineering across the food chain, from on-farm postharvest and sustainable processing to nutrient delivery in the body for sustained or improved health. Key learnings from the International Congress on Engineering and Food, ICEF13, held in Melbourne, Australia, in September 2019, are highlighted. Some of the food systems and innovation trends conveyed in keynote talks, oral presentations, and e-posters summarized here are detailed in the chapters of this book and in special issues of two reference food engineering journals. A global overview of biosystems engineering solutions for developed and developing countries includes alternative protein sources, postharvest engineering for food waste transformation and sustainability. Then, advances in food processing technologies including refrigeration, freezing, thermal and nonthermal processing, and drying are discussed. An update on the innovative use of technologies such as extrusion for alternative ingredient production and innovative texturization, 3D food printing for personalized structuring and nutrition, pulsed electric field or hydrostatic pressure for structuring, as well as precision fermentation and other methods for bioactive incorporation is provided. The chapter also covers advances in ecofriendly antimicrobial and intelligent packaging with in-built micro- and nanosensors. Other sensor technologies integrated into digital manufacturing using Industry 4.0 are presented in the context of the food supply chain. Engineers are increasingly involved in consumer health research by creating more representative in vitro mimetics of human oral processing and digestion devices that are coupled with nutrient delivery models. The chapter concludes with suggestions to modify the food engineering curricula to (a) prepare food engineers of the future for global challenges appearing in both developing and developed countries, and (b) develop broader technical, interpersonal, and integrated regional and global supply chain skills. Food engineering will continue to play an important role in the development of cutting-edge smart processes that transform and personalize foods targeting individual nourishment and improved body function via controlled delivery strategies. Therefore, food engineering is broadening the scope beyond conventional unit operations and process design and optimization, to include environmental assessments, bioprocesses in the human body, and digital tools to identify circular and cost-effective solutions, and develop sustainable food systems.}

Different board members’ experiences from their own perspectives are examined, with attention on capturing the influence of digital technologies on the way that board directors work. Thematic analysis offers a rigorous approach to analysis and enables articulating deeper and meaningful understandings of individual director experiences. Findings presented as a framework, indicate that DT impacts all board directors’ capabilities as four major aspects: gathering, interpreting and sharing information; board stewardship; blue-sky strategizing; and scoping predictive strategic priorities. Theoretical contribution is to Resource Dependence Theory (RDT) as an outcome-focused lens, which best explains a firm’s interest in digital technological advantage through board contribution and outcomes. In conclusion, practical insights for board members and regulators are highlighted.}

It has been proven effective over a plethora of private applications however, not many studies based on the public sector have been reported even though it is known to be inefficient. This is mainly due to an overall smaller market exposure of public administrations compared to private companies. However, nowadays, in the age of digitalization, the growing global competition is requiring PA to improve the efficiency of their processes. This paper offers a real case-study of an application of BPR in a PA namely the Genoa Port in Italy, one of the biggest ports in Europe. The following analysis has been carried out through an AS IS / TO BE approach and the outcome of the re-engineering process has been validated through Discrete Event Simulation. The results show how BPR can improve the efficiency of PAs and, particularly, how the port environment can drastically turn into an efficient and optimized system.}

Even though the benefits of relying on information systems to run everyday tasks, organise one's business, interact with each other or enjoy public services are undisputable, the increasing use of digital technologies comes with a price: the growing exposure to cyber risks. This new type of threat has been in the center of the EU agenda for over 15 years during which a solid legislative framework for the protection S of network and information systems against cyber incidents has been developed. However, security and resilience of infrastructures and networks is one parameter of the challenge. Dealing with the financial risk emerging from a cyber incident, is another, equally important one. The need to mitigate these risks led to the emergence of a new insurance market, the cyber insurance market. Despite though the constantly growing demand for this type of insurance coverage, the market is still under development. The fast-evolving nature of cyber threats, the lack of a common language as regards risks, losses and coverages and the lack of historical data on cyber incidents are listed among the factors that slow down the market's growth. Currently, all involved stakeholders in the insurance field are considering specific initiatives that would accelerate the process of turning the EU market more competitive and efficient against its many challenges. The example of the US cyber insurance market, with its shortcomings and know-how, could also contribute to this effort, as an example of a market that has been intensively facing these challenges for almost twenty years.}

abstract = {The global trend toward integration of distributed energy resources is opening doors to advanced, complex, and distributed marketplaces. Such advanced ecosystems, where utility-owned and non utility-owned assets can contribute toward grid operations, generally require distributed communication and grid architectures. We posit the potential of using Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) in supporting such applications, although their full potential has not been fully used, for example in designing long-term scalable solutions in operational technology applications. This is partly due to the lack of standardization across and between different DLTs, as well as other supporting building blocks (e.g., communication protocols). This paper attempts to address this gap by proposing a DLT cybersecurity stack specifically designed for researchers, DLT technology developers, and end users (such as utilities). The DLT cybersecurity stack has been notionally mapped to related cybersecurity components, namely the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite, and existing Smart Grid architecture frameworks. In addition, the paper discusses several cybersecurity implications, and demonstrates the potential uses of the DLT cybersecurity stack through multiple power and energy use cases. It is important to note that the stack can be also applied to the DLT use cases that are outside the power and energy domain. This work was performed by the Cybersecurity Task Force under the IEEE P2418.5 Blockchain for Energy Standard working group that part of the IEEE Power and Energy Society’s Smart Buildings, Loads, and Customer Systems (SBLC) technical committee.}

abstract = {Access to the many benefits available from digital technology can often vary depending upon the capabilities and facilities of the individual who is attempting to engage with it. Many digital devices and services require us to be identified and so require some form of user authentication as part of the process. However, the authentication methods that are currently dominant can prove difficult to use and do not meet the needs of users with disabilities. As such, they can constitute an additional barrier that is not faced by other users. This paper presents an assessment of different forms of user authentication (including various forms of secret, token and biometric approaches) against a range of potential disability categories that may affect their suitability for related user communities. The study draws upon disability classification identified by the World Health Organization and analyzes how the usability and/or security of current authentication methods fail users with disabilities due to their non-inclusive design. The discussion is based upon a combination of literature review and examination of real-life examples, and identifies aspects of current implementations that can cause problems in different scenarios. The findings suggest that biometric approaches are likely to be more directly applicable without incurring additional overheads, although even here the potential usability impacts are more prominent for some forms of disability. It is further recognised that while some methods can be made more accessible via assistive technologies, the primary aim should be for authentication choices to be as inclusive as possible by default, rather than expecting or requiring that some user groups should face an additional challenge to accessibility.}

Current literature on I4.0 technologies tends to overemphasise the positive impact and transformational capabilities of digital technologies while there is little focus on evaluating potential risks associated with their adoption in industrial operations. An understanding of how supply chain risks are perceived in digitalisation projects within industrial operations and an understanding of decision-makers' responses to different types of risks has important managerial implications. Current literature, however, lacks systematic empirical evidence on the implementation of I4.0 applications and related risk factors. This study aims to address this research gap by exploring the relationship between I4.0 technologies and supply chain risks based on empirical evidence from 300 case studies of industrial practice in Germany and fifty-three interviews with relevant managers from selected use cases and with general experts in this field. Our findings show that digital technologies are frequently adopted to address certain existing supply chain risks but that their implementation introduces new sources of risks (e.g. cyber risks). Based on qualitative data analysis and drawing on Normal Accident Theory, we propose a framework to explicate the drivers and contingency factors of new sources of supply chain risks in the context of Industry 4.0 technologies. Practical recommendations are provided for supply chain managers to guide the process of managing supply chain risks based on the technological life cycle.}

To demonstrate how smart farming solutions could influence future agricultural production, agri-business and rural communities and their constituents, this article compares smart farming approaches and reasons behind the pursuit of smart farming solutions by the U.S. and South Korea. The article compares agricultural assets and productivity among the two countries as well as the technical and societal challenges impacting agricultural production as a basis to understanding the motivations behind and pathways for developing smart farming solutions. In doing so, the article compares some of the technological and social advantages and disadvantages of smart farming, dependending on the choice and implementation of smart farming solutions. The South Korean government has implemented a national policy to establish smart farming communities; a concept that addresses the entire agri-food supply chain. In the U.S., a national plan to develop smart farming technologies does not exist. However, discrete smart farming solutions driven mainly by competition in the private sector have resulted in high-tech solutions that are advancing smart farming concepts. The differences in approaches and reporting of successes and failures between the two countries could facilitate the rate of evolution of successful smart farming solutions, and moreover, could provide pathways to facilitate sustainable development goals in developing countries where smart farming activities are currently underway.}

Meanwhile, the existing knowledge transfer schemes do not use privacy-preserving techniques for preserving security. This can be a problem for critical domains like financial market forecasting as the misuse of security can lead to legal and financial implications. In recent years, cloud services have revolutionized various technological applications. Cloud computing has become more popular with digital technologies as it provides uninterrupted services like transmission, storage, and intensive computing of data. The architecture of the cloud is also cost-efficient. Besides, various promising services from the cloud, some challenges need to be addressed to secure the privacy of the cloud users as millions of users access its services. Privacy preservation is an important aspect in the field of data mining, and the necessity of securing important data in the cloud from hackers is on the rise. Privacy-preserving data mining algorithms have been analyzed over recent years to provide sufficient solutions for securing the privacy of the data in the cloud. This paper plans to introduce a new hybrid meta-heuristic concept for developing a privacy preservation strategy towards business data under the cloud sector. The main objective of this paper is to design a new hybrid red deer-bird swarm algorithm (RD-BSA) to ensure higher convergence and since the use of control parameters over the solution generation is minimized. The proposed privacy preservation scheme on three financial databases is evaluated with the performance against the existing privacy preservation schemes. Different analyses like statistical, key sensitivity, Known-Plaintext Attack (KPA), and Chosen-Plaintext Attack (CPA) are used for evaluating the efficiency of the algorithm. The comparative analysis of the proposed model over the conventional models demonstrates its effective performance via diverse analysis.}

abstract = {Objectives
Little empirical research exists on how key stakeholders involved in the provision of care for chronic conditions and policy planning perceive the indirect or “spillover” effects of the COVID-19 on non-COVID patients. This study aims to explore stakeholder experiences and perspectives of the impact of COVID-19 on the provision of care for chronic conditions, evolving modalities of care, and stakeholder suggestions for improving health system resilience to prepare for future pandemics.
Design
Qualitative study design.
Setting and Participants
This study was conducted during and after the COVID-19 lockdown period in Singapore. We recruited a purposive sample of 51 stakeholders involved in care of non-COVID patients and/or policy planning for chronic disease management. They included health care professionals (micro-level), hospital management officers (meso-level), and government officials (macro-level).
Methods
In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted. All interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed.
Results
Optimal provision of care for chronic diseases may be compromised through the following processes: lack of “direct” communication between colleagues on clinical cases resulting in rescheduling of patient visits; uncertainty in diagnostic decisions due to protocol revision and lab closure; and limited preparedness to handle non-COVID patients’ emotional reactions. Although various digital innovations enhanced access to care, a digital divide exists due to uneven digital literacy and perceived data security risks, thereby hampering wider implementation. To build health system resilience, stakeholders suggested the need to integrate digital care into the information technology ecosystem, develop strategic public-private partnerships for chronic disease management, and give equal attention to the provision of holistic psychosocial and community support for vulnerable non-COVID patients.
Conclusions and Implications
Findings highlight that strategies to deliver quality chronic care for non-COVID patients in times of public health crisis should include innovative care practices and institutional reconfiguration within the broader health system context.}

As such, the paper provides a critical review of existing technologies and con-cepts that promote and contribute to the decarbonisation of seaports, including Smart Grids and Virtual Power Plants. Several avenues for future research are then discussed, including (a) total life cycle approach to seaport energy manage-ment, (b) Semantic-based modelling, forecasting and optimisation of seaports energy systems, (c) Secure and reliable seaports energy services, and (d) Transi-tion towards prosumer-driven seaport energy communities.

The terms analysis shows that “disasters”, “disaster prevention”, “humanitarian logistics”, and “human” are the most used keywords. The study identifies future research lines related to the interaction between critical technologies to deliver real benefits to the humanitarian supply chain. As a result, it proposes integrating the significant contributions of new technologies, such as blockchain, big data, artificial intelligence, 3D printing, virtual and augmented reality, and the social media relief phase following the disaster. It also indicates gaps in knowledge in terms of research related to human-made disasters and health emergencies.}

abstract = {Mass customized and mass personalized production has become facilitated by the fourth industrial revolution. The resulting industrial environments require the development of information systems able to take the specifications of customers and convey them to the production system in such a way as to contribute to the coordination of all the stakeholders and activities required to fulfill the orders of the customers. This is beyond the capabilities of traditional systems based on MRP and ERP, since the information should be managed in a flexible and decentralized way to exploit the Smart Manufacturing facilities of Industry 4.0. Blockchain, instead, is a technology that provides those features constituting a sound information supporting basis for mass customized/personalized production. Consequently, we explore the potential of blockchain as an information technology able to support industries that base their business models on mass customized/personalized production processes. This survey allows us to identify important challenges for further developments, highlighting three issues in the production setting: (i) to deepen the interoperability of systems, (ii) to generate more implementations, and (iii) to develop efficient consensus protocols. As a response to these insights we provide a conceptual design of how blockchain contributes to managing efficiently mass customized production systems. In our design the information of customer specifications can be fused with data from the production process to generate a plan to fulfill the demand. This design arises as a solution approach to three stated problem, which are faced by mass customized production systems.}

We use LDA topic modelling on a large sample of tweets (N = 1,059,731) by 16 business-to-business companies. We first analyse the official tweets sent by the official account of a company and compare them to the non-official tweets shared by other Twitter users and mentioning that company. We analyse gaps between the vocabulary and subjects identified in the corpus of official and non-official tweets and discuss the strategizing action of a company through social media. Findings shows the importance for business-to-business companies to consider the halo effect generated by social media as part of their omnichannel strategy and carefully monitor the amplification, confirmation or mitigation effect generated by actor networks shared meanings so to continuously align their intended strategic position.}

However, it is unclear as to the extent to which cyber-attacks can threaten border operations. Interestingly, no extensive research has been conducted into this topic, possibly due to the complexity and diversity of border controls. This paper specifies the cyber-threat landscape of border control infrastructures to assist professionals in assessing the relevant cybersecurity risks. Border control infrastructures are complex environments and relevant risks might not be easily identified. To investigate the cyber-threat landscape of these infrastructures, a mixed research method, combining qualitative and quantitative results, and using border-related expert interviews and risk analysis investigation was chosen. Key contributions of this work include the classification of a widespread set of border assets, the description of the profiles of threat actors and their potential synergies, the specification of a threat taxonomy applicable to all border types, and the identification of potential areas of vulnerability. Moreover, through the risk analysis investigations, exemplary input is developed to guide professionals while applying a risk assessment methodology in the context of border control infrastructures. The paper concludes with future directions addressed to policy makers and border professionals.}

The potential costs to society of these vulnerabilities are difficult to determine, as are their likelihoods of successful exploitation. In this article, we present a method for comparing the net economic benefits and costs of the various cyber-functionalities associated with smart grids from the perspective of cyberattack vulnerabilities and defending against them. The economic considerations of cyber defense spending suggest the existence of optimal levels of expenditures, which might vary among digital functionalities. We illustrate hypothetical case studies on how digital functionalities can be assessed and compared with respect to the costs of defending them from cyberattacks.}

abstract = {Industry 4.0 systems in general and advanced manufacturing systems such as collaborative robots, in particular, are characterized by a high level of complexity leading to new safety concerns. Safety, specifically for collaborative robots, has been mainly addressed from a technical perspective, to safeguard the physical safety of the operator. Concerns have been raised regarding less focus in Industry 4.0 literature on how other factors, such as psychosocial can produce safety-related risks for the operator in human-robot collaboration. This paper identifies and classifies the risk factors in a human-robot collaboration that have been described in research papers in the last decade. The resulting five classes constitute dimensions that will be used as preliminary building blocks for a safety evaluation framework to be developed in the next step. By evaluating the resulting classes with the underlying dimensions of contemporary socio-technical thinking, this paper demonstrates that these five classes offer a comprehensive, system-wide perspective including risk factors beyond technological considerations. Topics emerging from new risks related to the impact of working with collaborative robots, such as psychosocial, ethical, and cyber risk factors will need to be taken into account in the risk factors that are important to identify, assess and mitigate before working with collaborative robots. Operator involvement and participation, especially throughout the risk assessment and mitigation cycle are recommended as new areas of attention in human-robot collaboration. Going forward, one challenge will be the agility and adaptability of legislation to at least keep track of risk factors emerging from continuously changing technologies and to translate them into practically applicable tools for enterprises and design engineers implementing collaborative applications. Another key challenge will be the measurement of the new emerging and sometimes less technological risks.}

To fill this gap, this paper uses computer-aided textual analysis to explore the current practices of CTTI4.0 in the UK context. It also uses quantitative analysis to examine the impact of CTTI4.0 information on financial performance. The analysis shows that strategic investment decision-making (SIDM) practices for CTTI4.0 have accelerated over the period, and these practices vary in industry sectors. Furthermore, it finds that CTTI4.0 disclosure has a positive impact on financial performance. In addition, it finds that environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices moderate the relationship between CTTI4.0 disclosure and financial performance. This indicates that firms with better ESG performance tend to be more engaged in CTTI4.0 disclosure and better financial performance simultaneously. Our findings offer insights to decision-makers and regulatory bodies regarding the current practices of CTTI4.0 and its potential economic impact. Paper type: Research paper.}

Using a discursive psychology approach, we identify seven interpretative repertoires in the discursive practicing of digitalization: everyone-else, speed, competition, job loss, control, safety, and equality. Examining their functions and effects, we show that not only is digital transformation constructed as more productive, efficient, competitive, technologically advanced, safe, and equal, it also involves a shift towards the blue-collar worker being more vulnerable; a construction where she is able-minded but lonely, physically fragile, obtuse and unreliable, and a victim of a development beyond her control, forcing of her to acquire new competence. We conclude that this reproduces asymmetrical power relations between workers and companies, pushing the challenges of digital transformation to the workers. At the same time, we also see how these local discourses hold a possibility of tempering this asymmetry through the construct of togetherness of different contexts, bodies, and hierarchal levels, thus connecting steel industry workers of the future through the use of digital technology.}

These services also force their users to change their passwords periodically under specific policies to increase security. However, analysis of breached data reveals that current policies do not consider user password selection habits and pose critical security and privacy concerns. Additionally, when passwords are leaked, attackers have the opportunity to study - and possibly identify - the structure or pattern of the user password selection set. This way, attackers could predict the next password or reduce the search space considerably in their attacks. Therefore, this study proposes a novel behavior-based password policy to increase the present security level and avoid further exploitations if a breach occurs. This study uses statistical methods and visualization techniques to examine the password selection behaviors of over ten million UserID-password pairs collected from anonymously shared data breaches. The data set is anonymized while keeping the uniqueness of userID-password pairs and shared with other researchers along with extracted features. Results show that user password selection patterns can be generalized and used to increase the success rate of attacks.}

A new technological mix of mobile-apps, big data, blockchain, AI, cloud computing and digital platforms is taking place with unprecedented speed and is forcing traditional banks to consider this technology to form part of new collaborative value creation networks, such as digital business ecosystems (DBEs). Traditional payment habits based on cash and credit or debit cards are being replaced by new innovative formats of mobile instant payment among end users (P2P). Through a single case study – Bizum's DBE – the purpose of this research is to explore how successful was the defensive strategy developed by traditional banking entities with the objective to lead the new mobile instant payment ecosystem in Spain. The findings show that Bizum's DBE is helping traditional banking entities to create a superior digital value that is being adopted very quickly by a huge number of users in Spain. The main contribution of this study is the complete explanation of how a winning strategy of creation and development of a DBE can: i) ensure survival of incumbents in the face of threats from digital disruptive actors, and ii) transform consumer habits very quickly, due to the superior created value as a new solution for that need. We used the novel reformulation of the Modularity Theory (Baldwin, 2020c) which can be considered as a first step for a DBE-specific theorisation and supportive framework to understand the deep social impact of the different network effects generated.}

Moreover, banks' own specific FinTech capabilities, measured by patent applications and claims, have similar effects on bank performance. The implications are that when facing the development of FinTech, banks should focus more on the rising capabilities of FinTech technology than its difficulties and what the competition is doing. Small banks can particularly achieve business process reengineering and innovation more reliably by actively cooperating with FinTech companies.}

Openness to Industry 4.0 is measured by the breadth of the number of technologies adopted. The production recovery is measured by the perception of firms that a return to pre-COVID-19 production levels will happen within either 2021, 2022, or 2023. The study takes a representative sample of 2622 manufacturing small and medium enterprises across Italy (surveyed between October and November 2020) through a mediation analysis based on nonlinear probability models (KHB method). The results of the models show the following. First, openness to Industry 4.0 has a positive and significant direct effect on a perceived production recovery in the short term (within 2021) and medium term (within 2022 and 2023). Further, this effect is accelerated in the short term by digital reorganization and in the medium term by the addition of a classical reorganization. The research provides relevant managerial implications based on a large sample of current empirical data, showing that Industry 4.0 technologies, when adopted in tandem with the digital reorganization of production activity, can accelerate production recovery to pre-COVID-19 levels.}

This adoption increases the system attack-surface and the number of cyber threats capable of harmful business impact, such as leak of business data, disruption of business operations, and loss of reputation, intellectual property and financial assets. A supply chain network thus needs an effective cyber security and threat management strategy, which requires reaching a thorough understanding of the most important assets and resources in a supply chain traceability system, the cyber threats that may impact them, and potential countermeasures. This article contributes a comprehensive threat modeling report on supply chain traceability systems, where we make explicit more than a hundred relations between assets, threats and countermeasures of relevance to supply chain traceability. Our analysis is reproducible, extensible and falsifiable. Reproducibility is achieved by following a systematic asset-centric threat modeling approach and adopting the STRIDE threat model to present a description of common threats; extensibility by using a layered-architecture for supply chains which the analyst can accommodate to a concrete implementation; and falsifiability by providing the sources used to establish the relation (asset, threat, countermeasure). Albeit the focus of the analysis is on technology, for the sake of completeness, the article briefly analyses secure traceability in supply chains when people and processes are made part of the system.}

The case of driverless cars is considered. The paper points to a dearth of interaction between actors holding different and sometimes polar opposite views on what driverless cars could mean for the future of transport and society. It examines the role of bringing diverse perspectives together in a collaborative setting to address this wicked problem. The importance of creating task conflict is highlighted in the facilitation of engagement and achievement of shared learning. The Emulsion Methodology brings together into constructive dialogue (the emulsion) people with alternative perspectives on driverless cars (evangelists, opponents and agnostics) that may not typically mix (oil and water). The one-day workshop format (the emulsifier) involves co-creation, in mixed-perspective groups, of plausible utopias and plausible dystopias for a driverless cars future in 2050. The Three Horizons method is then used to identify significant issues at play in the transition to such futures. In turn, this enables guiding principles for present day policy to be identified. Application of the methodology to driverless cars resulted in new learning, changed perspectives and specific insights of relevance to policymaking.}

abstract = {Aquaponics, one of the vertical farming methods, is a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics. To enhance the production capabilities of the aquaponics system and maximize crop yield on a commercial level, integration of Industry 4.0 technologies is needed. Industry 4.0 is a strategic initiative characterized by the fusion of emerging technologies such as big data and analytics, internet of things, robotics, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. The realization of aquaponics 4.0, however, requires an efficient flow and integration of data due to the presence of complex biological processes. A key challenge in this essence is to deal with the semantic heterogeneity of multiple data resources. An ontology that is regarded as one of the normative tools solves the semantic interoperation problem by describing, extracting, and sharing the domains’ knowledge. In the field of agriculture, several ontologies are developed for the soil-based farming methods, but so far, no attempt has been made to represent the knowledge of the aquaponics 4.0 system in the form of an ontology model. Therefore, this study proposes a unified ontology model, AquaONT, to represent and store the essential knowledge of an aquaponics 4.0 system. This ontology provides a mechanism for sharing and reusing the aquaponics 4.0 system’s knowledge to solve the semantic interoperation problem. AquaONT is built from indoor vertical farming terminologies and is validated and implemented by considering experimental test cases related to environmental parameters, design configuration, and product quality. The proposed ontology model will help vertical farm practitioners with more transparent decision-making regarding crop production, product quality, and facility layout of the aquaponics farm. For future work, a decision support system will be developed using this ontology model and artificial intelligence techniques for autonomous data-driven decisions.}

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic, with its need for distancing, has necessitated the use of virtual care in never-before-seen volumes. This review article aims to provide a primer on virtual care for cardiovascular professionals in Canada. The technology to facilitate remote patient interactions is already available, but barriers exist. Adequate and effective cardiac virtual care must be further developed given the need for rapid evaluation and close ongoing follow-up of patients, as seen in the areas of management of heart failure, cardiac rehabilitation, electrophysiology, and hypertension. Many Canadian organizations have published resources to assist health care providers and patients navigate the unfamiliar virtual care landscape. Although there are concerns surrounding issues such as patient privacy, access to technology, language discrepancies, and billing, these deficits provide opportunities for growth by health care organizations and technology companies. The integration of virtual care, home-based devices, and disruptive technologies emphasize the trend toward virtualization of health care, with the potential for greater personalization of health care interactions and continuity of care. Funding models were rapidly developed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although some provinces have deemed these changes as permanent, the status from other provinces remains unknown. The foundations to support virtual care as a key modality for health care delivery in Canada have been built, and further developments may strengthen its viability as a long-term option.
Résumé
Dans le contexte de la pandémie de COVID-19 et de la distanciation sociale qu’elle impose, le recours aux soins de santé virtuels a atteint des sommets historiques. Le présent article de synthèse est une introduction aux soins de santé virtuels destinée aux professionnels de la santé cardiovasculaire du Canada. La technologie permettant de faciliter les interactions à distance avec les patients existe déjà, mais il y a des obstacles à sa mise en œuvre. Des soins de santé virtuels adéquats et efficaces doivent être développés davantage en cardiologie compte tenu de la nécessité d’une évaluation rapide et d’un suivi étroit et continu des patients, notamment quand il est question de prise en charge de l’insuffisance cardiaque, de réadaptation cardiaque, d’électrophysiologie ou d’hypertension. De nombreux organismes canadiens ont publié des ressources pour aider les fournisseurs de soins et les patients à trouver leurs repères dans l’univers peu connu des soins de santé virtuels. Les questions telles que la protection des renseignements personnels des patients, l’accès à la technologie, les différences linguistiques et la facturation soulèvent des préoccupations. Néanmoins, les lacunes constituent des possibilités de croissance pour les organismes de soins de santé et les entreprises technologiques. L’intégration des soins de santé virtuels, des dispositifs à domicile et des technologies perturbatrices met en lumière la tendance à la virtualisation des soins de santé, allant de pair avec la possibilité d’accroître la personnalisation des interactions et la continuité des soins. Des modèles de financement ont été rapidement élaborés au début de la pandémie de COVID-19. Bien que certaines provinces aient reconnu le caractère permanent des changements; la position des autres provinces demeure inconnue. Les conditions de base sont réunies pour que les soins de santé virtuels soient reconnus en tant que modalités clés de la prestation des soins de santé au Canada, et d’autres développements pourraient en renforcer la viabilité en tant qu’option à long terme.}

The framework uses an architectural model based on Design Patterns and Object-Oriented principles to guarantee a high cohesion and low coupling among its modules. In this sense, the main contribution of the present paper is to analyze the behaviour of an innovative communication framework in a realistic data transfer scenario. For this purpose, the multi-connection performance was evaluated based on packet throughput and computational cost on the processing device that receives connections from other nodes. Moreover, it was also considered the computational cost due to data encryption and the use of distinct hardware devices to validate the interoperability and define the limitations and constraints. For these purposes, some laboratory experiments were performed, demonstrating that the proposed framework is able to avoid a burst of data transfer for simultaneous connections and to support a good overall throughput in the server node (between 1406.14 and 2120.27 KB/s). Thus, the proposed framework represents a reliable and maintainable solution that can be embedded in smart meters.}

It has its own application domain to upload the clinical data of the patients and treatment procedures to the cloud server. Moreover, the data user may process the queries with suitable sensing parameters to obtain an appropriate medical record. As a result, the development of the Industrial Internet of Things (I-IoT) demands practical insights, trustworthiness, and reliability of intelligent automation to prevent the occurrence of potential risks in the process of production. In the past, multi-keyword searching (MKS) over encrypted cloud data has attracted researchers' attention. As cloud computing is highly practicing, data owners may easily outsource any kind of system data to commercial sites using the Industrial Internet of Things (I-IoT). However, data privacy and protection should be ensured using encryption techniques before any sensitive data is outsourced over insecure public networks. Providing cloud data encryption and secure keyword searching still exist as challenging issues. In I-IoT, cloud computing deals with a large amount of data users and documents, thus a technique like MKS is highly necessitated to process the search request and secure query processing. Thus, this paper presents a privacy-preservation phrase with multi-keyword ranked searching (PPP-MKRS) that introduces optimized filtering, binary tree index structure, and conjunctive keyword search to achieve secure searching efficiency. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed PPP-MKRS scheme consumes less computation, storage, and verification time in comparison with other searching encryption techniques.}

While the discussion on how to operationalize the new intelligent systems of the fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0, is still going on; the dominant characteristics of the fifth industrial revolution, Industry 5.0 – going beyond producing goods and services for profit – requires all to think and act differently. As a result of the convergence phenomenon, the boundaries between different disciplines are eroding, necessitating a thorough discussion on what engineering education should be like in the future. In this paper, after presenting a brief history of engineering education, the recent paradigm changes are discussed, which essentially stress that skills must prevail over degrees to deal with challenges posed by the trends of the fifth industrial revolution. Later, before concluding the paper four strategies are presented such as lifelong learning and transdisciplinary education (1), sustainability, resilience, and human-centric design modules (2), hands-on data fluency and management courses (3) and human-agent/machine/robot/computer interaction experiences (4).}

However, the question how these advanced technologies impact international business activities needs further attention. To this end, we adopt a multidisciplinary approach to review the related literature in international business (IB), general management, information systems, and operations research. We include the two latter fields, because advanced technologies have received more attention in these bodies of literature. Based on our analysis, we discuss the implications of these technologies for international business. Further, we highlight the drivers of technology utilisation by multinational firms and likely outcomes. We also provide future research avenues.}

This paper presents an integrated review combining quantitative and qualitative analyses to clarify the development roadmap of BIM-enabled building automation and robotics. Firstly, information and data management in Digital Twin and robotic building tasks is recapped as the prior knowledge. Secondly, a systematic review on BIM-related research topics in the last 18 years is conducted to demonstrate the inevitability and feasibility of BIM-robot integration, informed by the evolution of lifecycle building information flow. Then, critical analysis on three typical examples of BIM-based robotic construction (i.e. printing, assembling, and welding) are successively performed to reflect the potential BIM-robot integration mechanism and challenges ahead. Finally, a new unified robot-oriented BIM framework, namely BIMfAR, is proposed to conclude the cogitation based on the above analyses. Under the BIMfAR framework, definitions of basic concepts and a practical workflow are discussed to provide guidelines for future applications.}

abstract = {Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial and global impact on health care, and has greatly accelerated the adoption of digital technology. One of these emerging digital technologies, blockchain, has unique characteristics (eg, immutability, decentralisation, and transparency) that can be useful in multiple domains (eg, management of electronic medical records and access rights, and mobile health). We conducted a systematic review of COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related applications of blockchain in health care. We identified relevant reports published in MEDLINE, SpringerLink, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore, ScienceDirect, arXiv, and Google Scholar up to July 29, 2021. Articles that included both clinical and technical designs, with or without prototype development, were included. A total of 85 375 articles were evaluated, with 415 full length reports (37 related to COVID-19 and 378 not related to COVID-19) eventually included in the final analysis. The main COVID-19-related applications reported were pandemic control and surveillance, immunity or vaccine passport monitoring, and contact tracing. The top three non-COVID-19-related applications were management of electronic medical records, internet of things (eg, remote monitoring or mobile health), and supply chain monitoring. Most reports detailed technical performance of the blockchain prototype platforms (277 [66·7%] of 415), whereas nine (2·2%) studies showed real-world clinical application and adoption. The remaining studies (129 [31·1%] of 415) were themselves of a technical design only. The most common platforms used were Ethereum and Hyperledger. Blockchain technology has numerous potential COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related applications in health care. However, much of the current research remains at the technical stage, with few providing actual clinical applications, highlighting the need to translate foundational blockchain technology into clinical use.}

I discuss the literature based on primary research strands and their analytical contributions to understanding spatial developments in the context of Industry 4.0. The review highlights five main topics that current research focuses on: (1) Value Chains and supply networks (2) Clusters and industrial districts (3) Readiness and adaptation of regional industries (4) Innovation developments and ecosystems (5) Labor market. In the analysis, it becomes particularly clear that the embedding in the theoretical fields of economic geography is so far very thin. The paper calls for a multi-scalar understanding of Industry 4.0 and outlines future research avenues with a focus on the emerging topic of digital geographies. Scholars need to put an emphasis on the role of the geography of digital innovations within socio-technical systems to better understand the spatial dimensions of the fourth industrial revolution and its impact on the economy, society, and environment.}

Growing complexity in systems make such risks both more likely to occur and more difficult to anticipate. The tools for detecting systemic risk have not kept pace with these challenges; traditional methods are too intermittent, too slow, and too narrow in focus for timely systemic risk detection. However, recent developments in big data analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to revolutionize Early Warning Systems (EWSs) for detecting systemic risk. EWSs that are supported by these technologies could provide users with earlier warning signals of a wider range of risks and more up-to-date measures of the fragility of the system against these risks. This area of research is nascent and lacks a robust methodology for designing such EWSs. Addressing this issue, the present paper: 1) identifies the characteristics of competent EWSs; 2) outlines an approach for designing such EWSs; and 3) illustrates the value of this approach, by discussing the conceptual design of an EWS for detecting biosecurity incursions in the New Zealand pastoral industries.}

Further, it delineates the usage of advanced digital technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics (BDA), and internet of things (IoT) to bring on solutions/approaches to evolving to pandemic-constrained manufacturing. An overall of twelve key factors is determined from extensive literature reviews which are categorized into challenges and solutions. Here, ISM methodology has been used to establish the interrelationship among identified twelve challenges and solutions. Further, MICMAC analysis has categorized them according to their driving and dependence power. The consequences display the absence of autonomous factors whilst efficient supply chain, centralized decision making, product diversification, and JIT along with revenue generation turn out to be significant dependant factors. The facilitators like digital technologies are the pre-cursors to the ultimate solution of revenue generation and termed preliminary solutions. The outcomes of this research will suggest eventual policy recommendations for industry leaders to progress manufacturing within Covid-19 constraints.

abstract = {Nowadays, transmission system operators require higher degree of observability in real-time to gain situational awareness and improve the decision-making process to guarantee a safe and reliable operation. Digitalization of energy systems allows utilities to monitor the system dynamic performance in real-time at fast time scales. The use of such technologies has unlocked new opportunities to introduce new data driven algorithms for improving the stability assessment and control of the system. Motivated by these challenges, a group of experts have worked together to highlight and establish a baseline set of these common concerns, which can be used as motivation to propose innovative analytics and data-driven solutions. In this document, the results of a survey on 10 transmission system operators around the world are presented and it aims to understand the current practices of the participating companies, in terms of data acquisition, handling, storage, modelling and analytics. The overall objective of this document is to capture the actual needs from the interviewed utilities, thereby laying the groundwork for setting valid assumptions for the development of advanced algorithms in this field.}

abstract = {This paper introduces an innovative social process model addressing population-wide measures of voter preferences that was tested on data from the 2016 US presidential election. Population-wide, “macroscopic” parameters are needed when privacy, ethics or regulatory constraints block “big data” techniques (e.g., in political contexts to counter “micro-targeting”). Confidence will be eroded if existing trend models and other macroscopic approaches frequently fail to predict outcomes, however campaign data reveal mathematical features that suggest a different possible approach. Given that the populations modelled exhibit self-organisation and memory when transmitting viewpoints, our model is based on mathematical representations of such processes. Its validation indicates the applicability and potential generalisability of this theoretical approach. In order to design a stochastic dynamics model of changing voter preferences, we evaluated probability models for transitions between possible system states (magnitudes of voter preferences), formulated the boundary task for probability density functions and derived a second-order non-linear differential equation incorporating self-organisation and memory. We find consistent dependencies between influences on the system and its reaction, and it is congruent with empirical data. The ability to use researchable global parameters indicates the potential for modelling electoral processes and wider applicability for complex social processes, avoiding dependence on “internal” variables.}

Based on 73 responses, cybersecurity knowledge and skill would become essential for PFSOs than ever before because the port digitalization and automation would shape the PFSOs career to a technically-oriented specialist rather than a multi-skilled generalist. Furthermore, the responsibilities of PFSOs would extend to cover cyber risk management, which enables them to prevent the digital port facilities from emerging cyber threats. Therefore, they should learn how to incorporate the existing risk management process with cyber risk management and cybersecurity knowledge because these would be the foundation for PFSOs to practice cybersecurity skills. At the end of the learning process, PFSOs could also gain cybersecurity competence once they have mature knowledge and skill, which would be the vital element of port security hygiene.}

Our target participants in the survey include students from public and private universities in Bangladesh who will perform in the job market and who are already in the market. This is how we can bridge the gap between employers' expectations and students' perceptions of skills and competencies they acquire before entering the job market. After surveying and analyzing data collected from 361 undergraduate and graduate-level students, we found that both business and technology impact employment. Students are aware of the changing job market scenario, and they are trying to have those skills which will make them competent compared to the early years, but they are not prepared enough to accept the challenges faced in industry 4.0. This paper will be helpful for both the academicians to be aware of the future trend of the market so that they can prepare students to fight the challenges and do future research on them. At the same time, employers can get some ideas how students are thinking right now and how much training and development opportunity they should arrange for the newly recruited graduates who have lack expertise but if they are trained up, can be a source of strength for the companies.}

abstract = {In the context of video game, there is a notable convergence between the users and producers of content. There is also a tension between control over created content and innovative uses of that content, which arises from the gap existed between copyright law and the emerging practices of online communities. This paper examines a distinct form of player-contributed content, namely game Mods, through the perspective of social welfare rather than that of content creators. It argues that law is not the only factor affecting copyright owners’ decision-making behavior; social and economic factors also play an essential role. These factors explain why game developers may tolerate or even encourage minor alterations to their works but prohibit total conversion of the Mods. Given that the existing law and terms of service cannot serve as “effective cure” for regulating game Mods, this paper explores the social and economic factors that impact how game corporations address modding, framing these factors in a four-quadrant model according to the relative benefits and harm of Mods to game developers and users/modders. The inconsistency between the letter of the law and its practical application in the modding context suggests a need for law reform. Based on the findings of the above examinations, this paper proposes a two-pronged solution to the modding problem. The first prong concerns the social benefit of game Mods, aiming at changing the copyright regime from being exclusive to non-exclusive, which confers on gamers the legal right to modify video games without permission but obliges them to remunerate the original developers for commercial use of those Mods. The second prong concerns the potential social harm of game Mods and proposes a community-based approach, under which game operators are imposed a common law duty to monitor infringement and to ensure the fair implementation of game developers’ terms of service.}

abstract = {As a disruptive digital technology, adopting additive manufacturing impacts the state and structural dynamics of supply chains, thus affecting their capability to be resilient. Supply chain resilience is essential for business continuity and dealing with unforeseen disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, no research has exclusively investigated the implications of adopting additive manufacturing technology for supply chain resilience, and this study aims to overcome this knowledge gap by using the existing literature and drawing on the dynamic capabilities view. Hence, a systematic search of the literature followed by a critical review of the gathered evidence from 87 peer-reviewed journal papers is performed, leading to the generation of propositions on how additive manufacturing adoption impacts the state of the supply chain, thus influencing certain supply chain capabilities and vulnerabilities that affect supply chain resilience. These propositions provide a research agenda to empirically examine how adopting different processes and applications of additive manufacturing technology can affect supply chain resilience in different industries. Additionally, this study puts forward a detailed framework that indicates how and to what extent adopting additive manufacturing can influence the supply chain capabilities and vulnerabilities that underlie supply chain resilience. While the results suggest that adopting additive manufacturing is expected to improve supply chain resilience by mainly enhancing the state of the supply chain and positively influencing certain supply chain capabilities, it can also cause certain supply chain vulnerabilities to arise, which seem to be interrelated with some of the present additive manufacturing adoption barriers.}

The paper aims to extrapolate and organise recommendations for how to progress in these disciplines from a substantial number of studies. This is accomplished by a systematic literature review on publications within the period 2018–2021. For this purpose, a rigorous metadata analytics process is deployed to retrieve, filter, and structure large amounts of metadata to increase inclusiveness and transparency. The findings consist of 11 focus areas that are developed by extrapolating recommendations from the reviewed literature. These focus areas are structured using the technology-organisation-environment (TOE) framework, which is divided into subcategories. From these, three specific technology-focused recommendations are developed. Furthermore, the paper identifies some concerns with the current research methods due to the overall low implementation of Industry 4.0 in SMEs. This leads to suggesting that future research should engage in pragmatic research methods with attention to how digital technologies are applied in SMEs.}

To better analyze the different impacts, this paper proposes a new flight delay model that models the ATC system from two perspectives. In the air delay, we view the problem as an optimal path choice with a set of capacity constraints and consider the speed change, rerouting, and pathfinding. In the ground delay, the concept of cellular automata is extended to model the flight queue at each airport. Last, the system dynamics of delays are considered, and the two stages of modeling are combined using flight delay as an indicator to achieve an intuitive description of the impact on the system threat. Compared to the current state of the art, the model is shown to be a simple way to analyze the impact of different sophisticated threats. It also helps aviation system planners better understand the impact of different threats so that effective measures can be taken to improve system performance.}

A mixture of Blockchain and the IoT appears hopeful, even though blockchain requires real-time data application, and IoT describes processes to store and manage information overloads safely and proficiently. The technology is significant to the manufacturing business, experiencing a digital revolution by incorporating equipment, developments, and data, leading to the Industrial IoT (IIoT). Such a combination of IIoT and blockchain is termed Blockchain for Industrial Internet of Things (BIIoT). The paper gives a detailed survey on BIIoT and discusses all relevant aspects of this novel concept. Firstly, IoT as a concept has been explored briefly, and relevant threats to IoT has been investigated. Furthermore, the domain of IIoT and the relevant challenges to IIoT is discussed. Additionally, an overview of blockchain technology is presented. Subsequently, a combination of IIoT and blockchain is explored, and the BIIoT structural design proposal is submitted. Finally, issues related to the use of IIoT with blockchain for industrial applications of BIIoT is explored. Thus, all relevant open research directions in Blockchain and IIoT are summarized in this paper. This survey shows that the proposed BIIoT is used to develop a redundant, traceable, and secure complex interconnected IIoT environment. Furthermore, the BIIoT system enables us to communicate with each other without the need for a trusted intermediary in a decentralized, unreliable, peer-to-peer network.}

Many potential benefits of crypto assets for the financial sector are widely recognized, including cost savings, improved efficiency and transparency. The rapid growth of the crypto assets ecosystem has intensified the focus of regulators. They are challenged to provide an adequate response, protect investors and customers, and mitigate risks while fostering technological development. Currently, at the EU-wide level, there is a regulatory gap, which contributes to legal uncertainty and weak investor protection. Several European jurisdictions have been proactive and successfully designed their own national regulatory solutions to crypto assets. Many European and international supervisory and regulatory bodies contributed to the debate and issued reports, analysis and statements highlighting risks and making regulatory recommendations. The European Commission took the first steps to assume its competence over all crypto assets within the EU and, after a comprehensive review of the entire crypto assets ecosystem, issued a proposal for a regulation on markets in crypto assets. This paper evaluates the EU's current regulatory approach to crypto assets against the background of the views and reports of several advisory and supervisory bodies and international organizations and against market developments.}

Industry 4.0 is becoming recognised as a unique industrial paradigm. It is predicated on the widespread adoption of communication and information technology, which would lead to improved organisational performance and flexibility. The incorporation of Industry 4.0 is the true game-changer in terms of flexibility and customisation. Manufacturers may utilise this technology to build digital twins of items used by consumers in the real world. The digital twin gets real-time information from sensors on the actual objects. Manufacturers benefit from digital twin and simulation technology, including predictive maintenance and making errors easier and faster to rectify. This paper discusses Industry 4.0 and its Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) capability. Different dimensions and technologies of Industry 4.0 Practices for improving FMS performance are studied,d and then discusses several flexible approaches using Industry 4.0 technologies are. One of the most significant benefits of adopting virtual infrastructure maintained by a service provider is improved flexibility. Cloud services allow auto-scaling, which means that the underlying computer resources automatically adjust to changing utilisation rates. Industry 4.0 increases production flexibility, allowing a facility to respond to market changes quickly. A plant control system automatically varies output depending on shifting utility rates, lowering production costs. Industry 4.0 offers some incredible benefits and has gone a long way in the last several years.}

abstract = {Resource conservation through extended product lifetimes has emerged as a rising mantra in various domains related to the circular economy. Meanwhile, it appears that product lifetime extension (PLE) is increasingly achievable through sophisticated technological production systems encapsulated in the concept of industry 4.0. To help managers and researchers understand the potential of PLE offered by crucial Industry 4.0 technologies, this study provides a systematic literature review synthesizing conceptual and empirical research demonstrating the PLE-Industry 4.0 nexus. Using the Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) as an architecture reference model for Industry 4.0, we identify four key constitutive technologies of Industry 4.0 (i.e., Additive Manufacturing, Artificial Intelligence, Internet-of-Things, and Big Data) that may contribute to improved product design, access, maintenance, redistribution, and recovery. The findings provide meaningful strategies that are actionable by managers to extend product lifetimes.}

Smart technologies are transforming the dynamics of the food industry, requiring higher automation. The new phase of automation enables the sector to achieve optimized, reliable, and efficient processes, services, and products and demands new professional skills in its labor force. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the near-future skills requirements of the sector and the skills gaps between the current labor force and the industry needs. This chapter focuses on identifying the future skills demanded by the food industry. We present a sectorial database generated for the food sector profiles incorporating their current and near-future skills needs and an industry-driven and proactive strategy for implementing them. This database could be a fundamental framework to guide the food industry through the midterm industrial transformations, and can serve companies and academics.}

Digital Education has been approached from an instrumental point of view, focusing on the advantages that the introduction at an early stage of digital tools brings to the teaching and learning processes to ensure children can acquire the required 21st competencies of a future workforce. In the application for the Indian case, social, cultural, economic and educational data obtained through desk research during the first semester of 2021 has been taken into consideration. Despite significant Government efforts on scaling up Digital Education, primarily due to the Covid-19 pandemic school closure, the 0.596 DEIFDC score on a 0–1 possible range has shown Inadequate Digital Education Deployment, derived mainly from poor school infrastructure, limited pedagogical capabilities and modest students' skills. Furthermore, the socio-demographic differences observed among school children and the existent digital divide in rural and urban areas demonstrate that major effort needs to be undertaken to ensure vulnerable Indian population does not lag behind under the new rules of the Digital Economy.}

abstract = {The gig economy's disruptions on incumbent businesses have raised significant attention from policy-makers. This research focuses on one of the gig economy platforms, the online peer-to-peer (P2P) short-term rental (STR) platform. We examine how the governmental STR interventions affect the long-term rental (LTR) market. Using the prospect theory and the theory in the economics of regulation, we study the relationship between the STR regulations and the LTR rental prices. We find a nonlinear relationship between the STR regulation and the LTR rental prices through analyzing a constructed panel of monthly LTR and STR data from 15 cities across the United States. The nonlinear relationship between these two indicates that STR regulations only have a short-term impact on the LTR market prices but they cannot effectively contain the negative impacts of STR on the LTR market in the long run. Thus, policy-makers need to find alternative ways to govern the STR businesses. We discussed the related practical implications for gig economy research and policy-making.}

These organization digital business capabilities, in turn, require corresponding digital transformation and digital business management competencies. This has important implications for required hospitality management competencies. We identify the specific digital transformation and digital business management competencies required by hospitality managers. Then, given a disconnect between these competencies and previously identified hospitality management digital technology competencies, we propose a framework integrating digital transformation and digital business management competencies with previously identified digital technology competencies required by hospitality managers. The proposed framework has important implications for curricula design and managerial practice. These implications as well as future research ideas are discussed.}
