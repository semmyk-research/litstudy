abstract = {The digital age brings great promise for human development. Yet, the benefits of digital technology can only be realised by mobilising global cooperation to close persistent digital divides and address the harms, risks, and uncertainties of digitalisation. To date, the global digital landscape is dominated by private technology companies and a few governments of technologically advanced countries, while less developed countries and civil society actors effectively have no voice. The goal of the United Nations’s (UN) Digital Cooperation initiative is to maximise the benefits and minimise the costs of digital transformation while ensuring that no-one is left behind. The UN’s Digital Cooperation identifies the main directions for action but also acknowledges that persistent governance gaps undermine its cooperation efforts. This paper argues that we can learn how to improve global cooperation to govern the digital space by drawing on experiences from global environmental governance. Based on an extensive literature review, I show how existing governance gaps in global digital cooperation can be analysed and addressed. Specifically, I focus on the implications for the UN and identify which roles and functions it could take. Online misinformation is used as a compelling illustration of how lessons derived from environmental governance can inform responses to digital problems. The paper outlines an agenda that can set UN Digital Cooperation on a path towards success in mitigating the uncertainties the digital future will bring.}

Public health informatics is the scientific discipline that guides and supports improved capabilities in using health information and in designing effective health information systems. Benefiting from informatics principles and methods requires a disciplined assessment of current capabilities and a clear articulation of the vision and desired goals for improved information systems, information processes, workforce capabilities, organizational outcomes, and, ultimately, health outcomes. The informatics-savvy health organization (ISHO) framework was developed to provide a rigorous foundation and process for assessing current capabilities and planning for improved performance. This chapter explores the critical elements for implementing and monitoring the ISHO concept, including practical considerations for optimizing the impact of such assessment and planning efforts. A case study demonstrating the transformational value of this concept in a low- to middle-income country environment is included.}

Industry reports indicate that it is not a matter of if but when organizations become victims of cyber-attacks or breaches. In this research, we argue that organizations must enable agility in their incident response (IR) to quickly respond to diverse cybersecurity threats, and big data analytics (BDA) plays a pivotal role in enabling agility in the IR. Drawing from dynamic capabilities theory, we conducted a field study using a case study approach to examine the following research question: What dimensions of big data analytics-embedded dynamic capabilities enable agility in cybersecurity incident response? We develop a framework that presents five key dimensions of BDA-embedded dynamic capabilities (data consolidation, threat intelligence, incident investigation, analytical skillset, and cybersecurity analytics warehouse) in IR at four specific stages, that is, manual analysis, basic analytics, advanced analytics, and pervasive analytics. The detail of the framework explains how BDA-embedded dynamic capabilities at the pervasive analytics stage enable agility in IR by infusing agile characteristics of flexibility, speed, and learning in IR. This study contributes to the knowledge of IT-embedded dynamic capabilities and cybersecurity IR agility. Detailed recommendations are also provided for potential practitioners.}

It highlights that policies targeting 5G and 6G represent an interesting instantiation of a (relatively) novel and under researched type of EU industrial policy, which we describe as a “technology-specific” industrial policy. This approach, that departs from the traditional dichotomy between horizontal and vertical policies, has some desirable features that we highlight, but also raises some challenges. We focus on the key role these policies may play in drawing attention on demand and adoption patterns, especially if the implications of the GPT features of 5G and 6G are explicitly taken into account. The analysis suggests that much more emphasis should be given to demand-side innovation policies along with standard policies directed at final demand, to improving the vertical governance of EU policies so as to fully capture the technological opportunities key technologies open up and to the explicit consideration of the trade-offs behind the concrete implementation of this sort of policies.}

Despite the growing importance of digital platforms for industrial value creation, limited research has focused on their practical application in this context. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the holistic factors crucial for successful implementation is lacking. Through a qualitative empirical research approach involving three case companies in a manufacturing value chain, this study examines the challenges, requirements, and opportunities associated with leveraging digital platforms for resilient supply chains. Additionally, the paper demonstrates the use of a structured modelling technique, IDEF0, to identify interconnected antecedents that support the use of digital platforms in building resilience within manufacturing supply chains. The findings contribute to advancing knowledge in resilience modelling and dynamic capabilities for resilience, along with providing valuable insights for practitioners seeking to harness the potential of digital platforms for improved supply chain resilience.}

Following a systematic literature review, our findings support the conclusion that, even though ISO 13482:2014 has proven to be a substantial step towards regulating that type of wearable robot, it fails to address safety sufficiently and comprehensively. That failure results in a general overlook of critical legal, ethical, and social considerations when designing robots, with the consequence that seemingly safe systems might nonetheless harm end-users. Notwithstanding those limitations and impediments to the development of safe technologies, to date, there has been no thorough assessment of how the standard regulates the development of exoskeletons and whether it requires any improvement in light of ethical, legal, and societal considerations. To bridge this gap, we compile relevant areas for improvement concerning ISO 13482:2014 fueled by these considerations. We do so in an accessible manner and provide concrete recommendations to help decision-makers overcome the standard's drawbacks.}

Meanwhile, Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is recently envisioned as the Blockchain 3.0 stage, in which enabling DAO in the manufacturing domain could be a promising attempt and will lead to decentralized autonomous manufacturing. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts and decentralized applications have the characteristics of verifiability, decentralization, transparency, autonomy, and tamper-proofing, which can enable a mass individualization paradigm to realize the promising Industry 5.0 vision of resilience. DAO provides a probable manner to regulate cross-prosumer activities under the Industry 5.0 context. Inspired by this vision, our paper reviews the literature on Decentralized Manufacturing (DM) and Autonomous Manufacturing (AM). Then, these two streams of efforts are unified, and a manufacturing paradigm, named Decentralized Autonomous Manufacturing (DAM), is defined towards resilience in Industry 5.0. In this paper, a reference architecture of the DAM is given. Followed by a comprehensive investigation of the key enablers, challenges, and barriers in the implementation of DAM, based on the insights from this analysis, future research directions of DAM are highlighted. We believe that our effort can lay a foundation for positioning DAM in futuristic Industry 5.0 research and engineering practice.}

To enable ASN, PwVI resort.. to simple assistive devices such as the white cane. Modern architecture, increasing traffic volumes, and transport infrastructure pose new challenges and technological innovations e.g., self-driving cars (SDCs) and wearable assistive devices (WADs) are promising. PwVI cannot drive conventional cars. Meanwhile, there is remarkable progress in innovating SDCs and pedestrian WADs. Therefore, this review was motivated by the need to assess the operational implications of the technologies for ASN by PwVI. We focused on the components, functions, and operationalization of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) embedded in instantaneous sensor-platform--algorithm systems. Existing ADAS prototypes and research directions show the benefits of adopting appropriate technology (AAT) based on supercomputing and powered by artificial intelligence facilitating real-time perception and safe ASN by PwVI. SDC innovations can economically benefit pedestrian PwVI. The study used ASN for PwVI to present a novel model; Integrated Computer-based Technologically-Enabled Ability Model (ICTEAM); that redefines disability as a ‘technologically-enabled ability.’ The ICTEAM subscribes to optimistic sociology advancing technological rehabilitation of disability based on AAT, instead of ‘talk-show advocacy’ within social model.}

We empirically test our hypotheses using the Eurostat Flash Eurobarometer No. 486 data set, with a final sample of 16,365 SMEs. Our first contribution shows that an adequate understanding of digital transformation not only implies the identification of drivers of digitalisation but also a grasp of how these drivers act, highlighting the differential effect that internal capabilities and external support of the company in interaction have on digital transformation. Moreover, the results show that the effect of interactions between variables is transferred to the output variable in a non-linear process, which may contain an optimum produced by a differential combination of input variables. Second, the paper extends the research methodology, emphasising the importance of combining classic regression analysis with machine-learning techniques. Thus, using a systemic approach, we conclude that the combination of the explanatory power of regression models and machine learning allows us to quantify and explain how variables act, solving complex and non-linear problems.}

This paper seeks to illustrate how certain social groups imagine the smart home and how fears and promises related to the digitalized home shape the public social media debate in Germany. We advance the analysis of smart energy futures with a novel methodological approach which combines quantitative network analysis with qualitative discourse analysis. We apply our approach to the online discourse around ‘#smarthome’ on Twitter and related media spaces in Germany in 2018 and 2019, which unveils the contested German smart home imaginaries. We identify five discourse coalitions that constitute shared understandings and perceptions of smart home futures in the social media sphere in Germany: Threat, Hackable, Useless, Fixable and Opportunity. Those discourse coalitions form around specific storylines that reveal partly opposing perspectives and competing ideas on what smart home systems might or should entail for society. Our empirical analyses reveal that in Germany, the envisioned smart home is highly contested and public discourse on social media is dominated by actors who critically interrogate the promises and prospects of smart home futures.}

This paper draws on general concepts from argumentation theory, combined with key principles and concepts from probabilistic and narrative/scenario approaches to develop arguments and analyse evidence. We present the “Argument-Based Method for Evaluative Opinions”, which is a novel method for producing argument-based evaluative opinions in the context of criminal investigation. The method may be used stand-alone or in combination with other qualitative or quantitative/statistical methods to produce evaluative opinions, highlighting the logical relationships between the components making up the argument supporting a hypothesis.

abstract = {We characterize the process of digital transformation of Italian firms and the impact on TFP. Using information of unusual breadth on different types of investments in digital technologies, we consider various dimensions of digital adoption such as whether firms invested in advanced domains (like AI) or bundles of more than one technology. We investigate the effects of digital technologies on productivity using alternative criteria to classify firms as digital adopters. With our baseline definition, the estimated effect on the percentage change in TFP between 2015 and 2018 is about one percentage point (0.97). With more restrictive definitions of digital adoption, the estimated impact is found to be larger, and it is largest when digital adoption is associated with investments in at least one AI-related technology. We also show that, in general, the effect of digital adoption is more sizeable in the service sector, in larger firms and in older firms.}

abstract = {The comprehensive study delves into the potential of digital inclusive finance to mitigate the challenge posed by the resource abundance dilemma prevalent in China's resource-based cities. In contrast to previous research focusing solely on the direct causes of the curse, this study pioneers a fresh perspective by underscoring the contribution of digital financial mechanisms to combating the issue. It introduces a monetary strategy to address the curse within a digital framework. Leveraging an econometric model, the study analyzes extensive panel data encompassing 88 resource-based Chinese cities spanning the years 2011–2019 to validate its assertions empirically. The foundational regression model provides tangible evidence of the tangible impacts of the resource curse within these cities, thereby affirming its existence. Remarkable findings underscore that digital inclusive finance possesses the potential to significantly mitigate the repercussions of the resource curse in locales endowed with abundant natural resources. However, this ameliorative effect is not evident in cities lacking such resource abundance. Introducing the PTR model sheds light on the nuanced impacts pertaining to integrating digital access funding across various stages of progression. The outcomes illuminate the substantial influence of low and high a degree of digital incorporation financial intensity on the resource curse phenomenon. This intricate perspective challenges conventional notions of the resource curse, presenting governments with an innovative approach to addressing the issue through strategic allocation of funds to foster digital inclusion. In this context, this study contributes substantially to the discourse on sustainable economic development in regions rich in resources by elucidating the intricate interplay between digital finance and resource curse.}

abstract = {Due to complexity, the oil and gas industry use various sensors to collect data for analysis to maintain the safety and integrity of pipelines and associated infrastructures. There is an enormous amount of data available to conceal crucial information, including precursor data on failure modes and knowledge that may be analyzed. The availability of large amounts of data has enabled the development of analytical tools that integrate methods like predictive analytics using different decision-making models, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning. These tools are crucial for managing pipeline conditions, preventing unwarranted failures, enhancing asset performance, availability, and decision-making. Big data analytics enables energy companies to implement a proactive approach to pipeline condition assessment. By integrating real-time data from sensors embedded in pipelines, weather conditions, and maintenance records, it becomes possible to detect potential issues and predict anomalies. The application of big data analytics in the energy pipeline industry is still at its early stage, although literature review discusses big data in oil and gas, however, the application's specific relevance to energy pipeline integrity and condition assessment has been largely unexplored. Therefore, this study addresses the applications of big data analytics in energy pipeline condition assessment by investigating the challenges and benefits. Collaboration among pipeline operators, data scientists, and technology providers were emphasized for successful adoption. The study envisions a future where big data analytics will be crucial in enhancing pipeline safety, efficiency, availability, integrity, and reliability. Recommendations for further research were also provided, culminating in a proposed conceptual framework for adopting big data analytics in the oil and gas pipeline industry.}

Smart farming technologies (SFTs) have emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these challenges and achieve the balance between productivity increment and environment safety, yet their adoption rate remains relatively low and fragmented. Extant literature, consequently, has extensively investigated and discussed the factors that affect the adoption of SFTs. Although some prior reviews have attempted to assemble previous discourse concerning the adoption of SFTs, they fell short in offering a comprehensive, structural, and focal overview. Hence, this paper reviews the literature around the adoption of SFTs with a specific focus on software and/or hardware technologies that are usually utilized to manage in-field agricultural activities. Using a framework-based systematic review, the paper synthesizes findings from 182 empirical studies to provide an in-depth and retrospective overview of the main theories, characteristics, contexts, and methods. The paper also demonstrates a state-of-the-art integrative framework of the main drivers of and barriers to the adoption of SFTs. Finally, the paper suggests future pathways for prospective scholars to advance our knowledge and understanding of the phenomenon of SFTs adoption.}

At the core of this study lie these subsequent research inquiries: What are the foundational underpinnings of emerging smarter eco-cities, and how do they intricately interrelate, particularly urbanism paradigms, environmental solutions, and data-driven technologies? What are the key drivers and enablers propelling the materialization of smarter eco-cities? What are the primary AI and AIoT solutions that can be harnessed in the development of smarter eco-cities? In what ways do AI and AIoT technologies contribute to fostering environmental sustainability practices, and what potential benefits and opportunities do they offer for smarter eco-cities? What challenges and barriers arise in the implementation of AI and AIoT solutions for the development of smarter eco-cities? The findings significantly deepen and broaden our understanding of both the significant potential of AI and AIoT technologies to enhance sustainable urban development practices, as well as the formidable nature of the challenges they pose. Beyond theoretical enrichment, these findings offer invaluable insights and new perspectives poised to empower policymakers, practitioners, and researchers to advance the integration of eco-urbanism and AI- and AIoT-driven urbanism. Through an insightful exploration of the contemporary urban landscape and the identification of successfully applied AI and AIoT solutions, stakeholders gain the necessary groundwork for making well-informed decisions, implementing effective strategies, and designing policies that prioritize environmental well-being.}

However, there are observations about blockchain limitations such as higher energy consumption, secure data, self-maintenance reliance, and higher cost. These constraints can be overcome by incorporating encryption algorithms into accepting blocks of data. In this paper, we propose a secure intelligent computational model for a large-scale interconnected IoT environment; an analytical modeling technique is considered for the proposed system. The proposed system takes advantage of the potential security feature of blockchain, which is considered the most appropriate secure communication system in an IoT. A computational model is built using the proposed blockchain technology to incorporate a secure and intelligent communication system. The proposed system uses the enhanced McEliece encryption approach’s potential to link the blockchain due to the faster mode of encryption and decryption process with a highly reduced number of steps.}

However, the mechanisms through which government may act are quite diverse. In this paper, we compare the national strategies across the 27 countries members of the European Union. We map each country's initiative to 14 barriers to the adoption of digital technologies in manufacturing observed in the literature. We observe that most institutional efforts focus on providing funding, developing new regulatory frameworks related to data privacy and security, and creating human capital. Some known barriers to adoption observed at the firm level, such as the lack of off-the-shelf solutions, or the need for retrofitting old equipment, are largely overlooked. We do not find any relationship between the number of initiatives proposed by each country, and the country's existing level of digitalization. We conclude by proposing several policy recommendations, as well as directions for future research.}

We construct an index of fintech adoption by banks by considering several factors such as banks' digital presence, mobile banking capabilities, support for open APIs, fintech partnerships, digital payment solutions, automation and artificial intelligence integration, innovation initiatives, user experience focus and embracing new technologies. The regulatory environment is measured through the existence or introduction of fintech-related regulations such as the regulatory sandbox. The findings imply that fintech adoption has reduced banks' stability in GCC. The fintech-stability relationship varies over various bank-specific and country-specific variables. For instance, large and well-capitalized banks are less likely to experience adverse effects of fintech adoption. Moreover, the negative impact of fintech on financial stability is lower for Islamic, foreign and government banks. In addition, banks operating in well-developed and more competitive banking sectors experience lower financial instability when adopting fintech innovation. We confirm these findings with an alternative indicator of fintech adoption. The study also discusses essential policy implications for the sample countries.}

It emerges from the confluence of operational technologies (OT) and information technologies (IT), which allows for higher flexibility and manufacturing of unique custom products to suit individual customer requirements. To assure quality, embracing digital transformation of non-destructive evaluation is essential. It can be an integral part of the cyber-controlled production and asset life-cycle maintenance. These two value propositions covering the asset life cycle, require digitally controlled NDE procedures and qualitative data to support automated decision making, for most known situations. With that scenario, NDE must be considered in conjunction with other engineering disciplines. Reliability assessments become a necessary prerequisite for the use of NDE data. In addition, the approach to inspector certification and experience needs to be revised. The digital technologies that are being deployed to enhance production under industry 4.0 can very well be the enablers of digitalized NDE and their integration with the asset and its owner. Model-based definition, smart robots, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and digital twins can all be used to enhance NDE inspections to a new level of performance in quality and safety assurance. These new NDE trends are summarized under the term “NDE 4.0” to meet the needs of Industry 4.0. The present review paper is aimed at capturing recent advances in digital technologies for non-destructive inspections, examples of their use, and other aspects that must be addressed to shift the paradigm. The paper also highlights the global collaboration and current trends, with an intent to inspire industry professionals to engage with NDE 4.0 – a must for Industry 4.0.}

At present, in the whole life cycle of an object in the AEC industry, it is mostly applied in the operation and maintenance (O&M) stage. Although there is a lot of DT application research, these studies are scattered across different topics in different engineering objects of the AEC industry. The common application strategy for the applications of DT in the O&M stage of the AEC industry has not yet been fully understood. So many fresh researchers who want to apply DT to new problems in the field are not clear which technologies should be used and how to organise them together. In this regard, the optional enabling technologies are given based on a bibliometric search, and a complete common strategy for DT application in the O&M stage of the AEC industry is established, which supplements the theory of the AEC field. Meanwhile, the existing gaps and research opportunities at the technical level are secondly identified. To achieve this goal, there are 825 publications related to DT applications in the AEC industry O&M stage are analysed, published between 2016.1.1 and 2023.7.28. The digital twin enabling techniques are summarised from four aspects in the paper. Firstly, the common technologies used in different current research topics are concluded and analysed in the review. Then, the enabling technologies for digital twin are concluded systematically from the perspective of the digital twin five-dimensional model. Thirdly, integrating technologies commonly used for each component based on widely recognised strategies for digital twin applications, a digital twin application technology strategy is finalised for the AEC industry O&M stage.

The findings reveal that DTs have a positive and moderate effect on overall firm performance; however, the impact on innovation performance is the largest, followed by operational efficiency, and finally, financial performance. Moreover, the results show that the impact of AI on firm performance is the largest, while 3DP exerts the lowest impact. Furthermore, boundary-spanning conditions—contextual factors (i.e., firm size, firm age, sector, country development, sector technology intensity, time frame) and methodological factors (i.e., study type, sampling technique, type of performance measure)—moderate the focal relationship (i.e., account for between-study variance).

In this study, we bring these two aspects together by applying an institutional and contingency theory perspective. We investigate the institutional forces and the effect of environmental contingencies on the digitalization of supply chains. We propose a generalizable model to investigate digitalization readiness independent of the technological artefact being implemented. To achieve the same, we identify the forces of digitalization in the supply chains from the review of the extant literature. We then model the forces of digitalization into a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN). The study finds that organizational readiness and people readiness are critical elements of digitalization readiness. Our study reports the importance of top management's involvement and employees' training as the critical forces aiding digitalization.}

The means of accurately assessing and improving the level of urban resilience (UR) to cope with disturbances and shocks, enhance regional resilience, and improve sustainable urban development has become a hot topic. In this study, we constructed an UR assessment framework using “social-economic-institutional-ecological-engineering” to explore the dynamic evolution of spatial and temporal patterns in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China, to reveal the main factors influencing the evolution of this spatial pattern and the strength and interaction mechanisms among such influencing factors and to dynamically simulate the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics in the next 16 years. The results show that from 2000 to 2019, the difference in UR level in the GBA is obvious. Hong Kong and Macao are obviously ahead of other cities, and the comprehensive resilience level of Guangzhou and Shenzhen cities in the mainland is developing rapidly. The difference in per capita consumption capacity, industrial structure optimization, foreign trade vitality, infrastructure support and other factors are the main causes of the spatial differentiation of UR in the GBA. In the future, the UR level of the GBA urban agglomeration will show an overall upwards trend. The three development poles of Guangzhou-Foshan, Shenzhen-Hong Kong, and Zhuhai-Macao have obvious advantages in spatial distribution. The results of the study can enrich regional UR research, and also provide theoretical references to facilitate the high-quality development of the area.}

However, the integration of blockchain-IoT has not been explored extensively in past research. This research provides a complete analysis of the enablers for using blockchain-IoT to manage logistics and supply chains. It aims to explore and prioritise various enablers for its adoption. The Diffusion of Innovation and the Technology-Organisation-Environment theories are used in this research to examine blockchain-IoT adoption enablers. The enablers identification is confirmed using the Fuzzy-Delphi technique and then analysed using the fuzzy - Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory tool to determine the strength of cause-effect hierarchical framework. The sensitivity analysis is also carried out to address the robustness of the results obtained. In order to measure the extent of a firm's readiness to adopt blockchain-IoT, a framework based on Graph Theory Matrix Method is proposed. It is illustrated with the help of a real life case. The results revealed that ‘sustainability focus’, ‘emphasis on emerging technology by organisation’, and ‘technology maturity’ are the top three enablers for blockchain-IoT adoption. Findings of study may motivate managers to include blockchain-IoT into their strategic planning processes based on their categorization of enablers into cause and effect categories. The research findings may also be used to the creation of efficient Blockchain-IoT deployment methods.}

Adoption of new technology is important for firms to remain successful and achieve sustainable competitive advantage in the production and distribution of goods/services. The purpose of this study is to explore the critical success factors (CSFs) affecting the adoption of Additive Manufacturing (AM) in mainstream manufacturing in enhancing supply chain competitiveness and sustainability. As a methodological contribution, this research uses a mixed methods' approach. An Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) derives five CSFs: 'customized production with speed'; 'sustainable production'; 'flexible manufacturing system (FMS) for complex products'; 'standardization in AM industry'; and 'digital skills & infrastructure’. The Analytical Hierarchic Process (AHP) shows the weights of factors. TOPSIS (Technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution) ranks the four manufacturing enterprises based on EFA factors. Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) establishes the cause-effect relationship among factors. This study finds that 'customized production with speed’ is the most influential causal factor and ‘sustainable production’ the main effect factor. AM adoption helps industrial sectors in advancing with new technologies, advanced materials, and organizational structures so as to enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of manufacturing supply chains. It has a great potential to reconfigure supply chain (SC) structures in such a way that sustainable competitive advantage is achieved with less lead time and negligible adverse impact on the environment.}

However, it is still associated with several disadvantages, such as higher risk of theft, misuse of financial resources, and/or corruption. Novel information and communication technologies are potential solutions for coping with these CBA-related disadvantages. However, the transition from in-kind or traditional CBA to digital CBA depends on many factors, such as the state of digitalization of the responding humanitarian organization, the financial market in the countries of deployment, or the accessibility to digital CBAs by the beneficiaries. The respective scientific and practitioner communities provide several experiences from past deployments. However, existing experiences provide only organization- or operation-dependent and thus anecdotal evidence. This paper follows a systematic literature review to construct a structured overview of the identified potentials and limitations of digital CBA projects. To evaluate the literature review results, we conducted two case-based evaluations to examine the validity and transferability of the identified potentials and limitations. The resulting structured overview promises to assist humanitarian organizations in pre-assessing appropriate CBA modalities for their programs. Furthermore, our findings suggest a high degree of context dependency on digital CBA and the lack of universally applicable potentials and limitations. As a theoretical contribution, the structured overview of the identified potentials and limitations can be used for the design of a research agenda towards the development of suitability assessment frameworks.}

Given the pressure to effectively address sustainability challenges and nurture firms' non-financial performance, SCE has seen a significant increase in academic research publications. Nevertheless, the diffusion of SCE practises has encountered many hurdles as the application of disruptive DTs poses significant challenges to companies. In addition, SCE faces the CE challenges too. The extant literature lacks a comprehensive investigation of scholarly articles on this topic. Therefore, this study investigates the drivers, enablers, and barriers to the diffusion of SCE. To fill this gap, we conducted an in-depth literature review of 87 articles gathered from Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and Google Scholar for citation chaining. This systematic literature review (SLR) classified five clusters for barriers and drivers. Existing research gaps in SCE have been identified, and future research avenues have been developed to illuminate the nuances of SCE implementation and diffusion.

Based on 10 years of data for 264 banks from 43 countries, we find that digitalized banking operation is an underlying driver of operational risk that comes with increased business volume. Banks proactively take more operational risks by increasing cyber spending to tackle FinTech competition in the digitalized economy. Digitalization could generally matter for operational risk exposure, but the natural experiment does not find cybersecurity threats per se could increase operational risks even though cybersecurity appears to be a serious threat to digital banking.

The intricate strands of human intelligence are seamlessly interwoven with the fabric of technological progress, giving rise to exquisite patterns of synergy and collaborative innovation. Automation is just another step in this process which started with the industrial revolution and now has paved way towards urbanization. Smart homes or home automation is a subset of Internet of Things (IoT) based automation that has added into the comfort, ease, and quality of our living standards and is now being integrated to form the concept of Smart Cities. In the past decade, various techniques and processes of smart home automation have been proposed and implemented. To extend and translate the existing methods into new one, the understanding of the former is imperative to the research procedure. This review stands as a comprehensive exploration, diving into the pivotal role of intelligent systems and expert knowledge in driving the transformation of smart homes into sustainable smart cities. By meticulously analyzing and aggregating an array of contemporary techniques used in smart homes, this paper offers profound contributions to the intersection of urban evolution and technological innovation. The review’s holistic approach not only facilitates a deep understanding of smart homes’ contributions but also charts a course for innovative strategies in city planning, infrastructure, and technological integration. In bridging the gap between technology and sustainable urban development, this exploration underscores the transformative power of leveraging smart home techniques to lay the foundation for harmonious and forward-thinking smart cities. The technologies cover a wide range of methodologies and intelligent systems used for communication, security and management in an urban infrastructure. The paper focuses on analysis of the technology to provide an outlook into achieving the goal of sustainable smart cities and deal with challenges like scalability and big data computation. Our comprehensive analysis yields a holistic set of technology comparisons and illuminates the promising future prospects within this domain. The information is highly insightful in creating a bigger picture for adopting state of the art technologies like Federated Learning (FL), Digital Twin and Embedded Edge computing in better planning and infrastructure management in smart cities. These findings offer reliable and potent methods to chart not only the course of research but also to enhance these technologies for the betterment of mankind’s convenience and advancement.}

abstract = {CONTEXT
This research paper details the response to a central challenge of the digitalization of agricultural systems which stems from information overload and the broad heterogeneity of agricultural technologies and the classification thereof. It is the result of four years of effort on the Horizon 2020 SmartAgriHubs (SAH) project, whose purpose was the development and connection of Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) and Competence Centres (CCs) related to the agricultural sector in Europe. CCs form the backbone of DIHs and provide the digital technological infrastructure by offering advanced technical expertise, access to the latest knowledge and information on digital technologies, and other technological and scientific infrastructure. However, the lack of a general framework for technology classification in agriculture needed to be remedied, not only to specifically advance the general aim of SmartAgriHubs and DIHs to “connect the dots”, but in general, so as to facilitate a broad range of actors involved in digitalisation of agriculture.
OBJECTIVE
This paper sets out the conceptual framework for the classification of technologies in the agricultural sector, and the development of the “Agricultural Technology Navigator” (ATN) as an iterative tool for gathering and searching for information to support such classification, so that actors involved in the digitalization of agriculture may more easily find and communicate technologies related to digital solutions.
METHODS
A multi-actor, multi-disciplinary expert group was formed to identify technologies and define keywords. A literature, patent, foresights studies, and grey literature review was also carried out. Text mining techniques, using the JCR “Tool for Innovation Monitoring”, were used based on keywords selected by experts for documents analysis (+170,000,000 publications; + 22,000,000 patent applications; + 77,000 projects). Gaps in previous studies were identified to form the basis upon which to create a new classification system. Taking into account the fact that technologies are continually developing and evolving, an iterative approach was also necessary. To this end, a new tool was developed, compatible with agricultural supply chains, to gather “bottom up” information from CCs (and other actors) on innovative digital technologies and solutions.
RESULTS And Conclusions
The main results of all the publications, patents and projects summarized herein, provide a scientifically sound foundation for a much-needed classification of digital technologies used in agriculture. This paper analyses different dimensions or categories in which the diverse technologies can be classified and selects the most appropriate classification to describe the technologies which could be used and managed by CCs and other agricultural actors, in offering and searching for systems and competences which provide digital solutions.
SIGNIFICANCE
Given the importance of DIHs and CCs, and more recently European DIHs (EDIHs), in the European agricultural policy agenda and the development of the sustainable digitalization of agriculture, it is necessary to have a mechanism to appropriately classify digital technologies relevant for agriculture so that providers and users can “match-make” and easily offer, find, and decide on relevant digital tools and solutions. CCs are not the only entities that benefit from such classification. A diverse range of actors involved in the sustainable digitalisation of agriculture, such as technology companies, farm advisors, machinery and other input suppliers who develop and deal in novel and different technology innovations, can benefit from being able to describe appropriately their technologies as part of agricultural systems and solutions.}

RTIMS are created to enable minimal-latency (real-time) of information delivery and usage to enable dynamic and smart decision making. However, being an emerging concept, it is unclear what the target readiness of RTIMS should be. As a result, system owners may face challenges identifying appropriate RTIMS performance models. In this study, RTIMS is treated as an integration of information, as a resource and as the systems for managing this resource, in real-time, across all phases of the mining value chain. Consequently, the capability maturity assessment tool for RTIMS must consider: information as the critical resource; the management systems for the critical resource; and the access to the resource in real-time. Thus, a hybridised maturity model is proposed for the RTIMS maturity target, which can be further optimised through stakeholder engagement. In our proposed framework, three elements namely, people, the environment, and technology, have been identified as key enablers for RTIMS in the minerals sector. In addition, we propose a six-level capability maturity model, with levels ranging from 0 to 5, signifying the state of no recognition of the processes to an optimised state, where prevention and maintenance are the norm.}

Both have already had a significant impact on various aspects of modern life, including transactions, and each one has already been under scientific investigation. Instead, their interaction has not become the subject of a debate, although it can further (positively) affect the transactions. This interconnection takes place through specific mechanisms, called Oracles, which can be, among others, highly sophisticated Artificial Intelligence systems (autonomous systems). The present article aims to present the role of the Artificial Intelligence Oracles throughout the ‘smart contractual procedure’, as well as to shed light on the potential (new) legal issues this interconnection may raise. The main result of this article is to indicate the appropriate legal directions in case of Artificial Intelligence Oracles’ failures, based on the most prevalent current approaches to AI's (the user's) contractual and/or non-contractual liability. The major research's conclusion is that the Artificial Intelligence Oracle's failures may result in one of the following situations: (a) breach of a (smart) contract, (b) unjust enrichment, (c) conclusion of a (voidable) smart contract that should not have been concluded, or (d) non-conclusion of a smart contract that should have been concluded. The responsibility of each person participating in the ‘smart contractual procedure’, i.e. the contractual parties, the blockchain platform and the Artificial Intelligence user/owner (or even the Artificial Intelligence system itself), as well as the AI provider or designer, is examined in each of the afore-mentioned situations separately. Given that legislative initiatives have already begun, the present article aspires to contribute to the consistent address of the newly raised legal issues.}

Additionally, it conducts a direct comparison between Vietnam and Thailand, shedding light on their relative standings. The primary contribution of this paper lies in its devised approach for measuring the digital economy. This methodology generates meaningful estimations of the digital economy's size and drivers within a specific country. Moreover, these estimated results are suitable for cross-country comparisons. Concurrently, applying this approach to analyze Vietnam and comparing it with Thailand reveals valuable insights. Firstly, Vietnam's digital economy, amounting to US$17,458 and comprising 7.9% of GDP in 2018, exhibited consistent expansion during the 2012–2018 period. Secondly, the ICT sector, particularly foreign-invested ICT hardware manufacturing, contributes roughly 50% to Vietnam's digital economy, while contributions from backward linkages and digital transformation each account for 20–30%. Thirdly, the non-ICT sectors' contribution to the digital economy is quantifiable through three avenues: purchasing digital products and services, supplying the ICT sector, and generating value-added from within-sector digital transformation. Lastly, compared to Thailand, Vietnam lags in key digital economy metrics. Notably, the Thailand/Vietnam ratio for value-added in 2018 was 3.9 for the total digital economy, 3.2 for the ICT sector, 3.1 for contributions from backward linkages, and 6.4 for non-ICT sector digital transformation, while the ratio for GDP stood at 2.1. This insight underscores that while investing in digital infrastructure, promoting internet adoption, and attracting FDI to ICT hardware manufacturing are essential, they alone are insufficient for the rapid progress needed in advancing Vietnam's digital economy.}

abstract = {In the context of the digital transformation of the electricity sector, the most recent technologies in power substations has promised benefits related to improved engineering, operations, and maintenance, transforming them into “smart” substations. However, methods and tools to analyse the impacts and estimate the benefits of electrical substation digitalisation to support investment decision-making have rarely been reported. We propose a comprehensive framework for assessing the impacts of the digitalisation of electrical power substations. Literature review, interviews with stakeholders and an expert survey were carried out to better understand those impacts and support the definition of the conceptual model. The framework identifies six key technological drivers and a total of 12 impacts, establishes the relationships between them, and defines key performance indicators for quantifying the impacts. The proposed framework was applied in a case study of the digital retrofit of a distribution substation on the scope of a research and development project on intelligent substations. The application demonstrates the framework's usefulness as a tool to systematically assess digital substations and highlights how digitalisation can benefit engineering and construction, and operations and maintenance activities. The proposed framework can also be applied to other contexts, thus contributing to an increasingly digital and connected electricity sector.}

abstract = {The optimal liability framework for AI systems remains an unsolved problem across the globe. With ChatGPT and other large generative models taking the technology to the next level, solutions are urgently needed. In a much-anticipated move, the European Commission advanced two proposals outlining the European approach to AI liability in September 2022: a novel AI Liability Directive (AILD) and a revision of the Product Liability Directive (PLD). They constitute the final cornerstone of AI regulation in the EU. Crucially, the liability proposals and the proposed EU AI Act are inherently intertwined: the latter does not contain any individual rights of affected persons, and the former lack specific, substantive rules on AI development and deployment. Taken together, these acts may well trigger a “Brussels effect” in AI regulation, with significant consequences for the US and other countries. Against this background, this paper makes three novel contributions. First, it examines in detail the liability proposals and shows that, while making steps in the right direction, they ultimately represent a half-hearted approach: if enacted as foreseen, AI liability in the EU will primarily rest on disclosure of evidence mechanisms and a set of narrowly defined presumptions concerning fault, defectiveness and causality. Hence, second, the article suggests amendments to the proposed AI liability framework. They are collected in a concise Annex at the end of the paper. I argue, inter alia, that the dichotomy between the fault-based AILD Proposal and the supposedly strict liability PLD Proposal is fictional and should be abandoned; that an EU framework for AI liability should comprise one fully harmonizing regulation instead of two insufficiently coordinated directives; and that the current proposals unjustifiably collapse fundamental distinctions between social and individual risk by equating high-risk AI systems in the AI Act with those under the liability framework. Third, based on an analysis of the key risks AI poses, the final part of the paper maps out a road for the future of AI liability and regulation, in the EU and beyond. More specifically, I make four key proposals. Effective compensation should be ensured by combining truly strict liability for certain high-risk AI systems with general presumptions of defectiveness, fault and causality in cases involving SMEs or non-high-risk AI systems. The paper introduces a novel distinction between illegitimate- and legitimate-harm models to delineate strict liability's scope. Truly strict liability should be reserved for high-risk AI systems that, from a social perspective, should not cause harm (illegitimate-harm models, e.g., autonomous vehicles or medical AI). Models meant to cause some unavoidable harm by ranking and rejecting individuals (legitimate-harm models, e.g., credit scoring or insurance scoring) may merely face rebuttable presumptions of defectiveness and causality. General-purpose AI systems and Foundation Models should only be subjected to high-risk regulation, including liability for high-risk AI systems, in specific high-risk use cases for which they are deployed. Consumers, in turn, ought to be liable based on regular fault, in general. Furthermore, innovation and legal certainty should be fostered through a comprehensive regime of safe harbours, defined quantitatively to the best extent possible. Moreover, trustworthy AI remains an important goal for AI regulation. Hence, the liability framework must specifically extend to non-discrimination cases and provide for clear rules concerning explainability (XAI). Finally, awareness for the climate effects of AI, and digital technology more broadly, is rapidly growing in computer science. In diametrical opposition to this shift in discourse and understanding, however, EU legislators have long neglected environmental sustainability in both the draft AI Act and the proposed liability regime. To counter this, I propose to jump-start sustainable AI regulation via sustainability impact assessments in the AI Act and sustainable design defects in the liability regime. In this way, the law may help spur not only fair AI and XAI, but also sustainable AI (SAI).}

Unlike other studies, this study investigates the disaster response phase from a meta-level perspective. By establishing Causal-Loop-Diagrams (CLDs), the impacts of internet blackouts on information flows in organizations are visualized and analyzed. A Building Block Model, consisting of generic blocks applicable to organizations of different economic sectors, is introduced. An adaption to sector-specific requirements is demonstrated for the transport and health sector.

On the other hand, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is seen as an important tool that can enhance AEC industry. However, BIM adoption might not at the desired level taken into the account of perception differences on BIM use benefits across the professions of AEC industry. Studies on the BIM adoption of construction organizations show that one of the most fundamental factors affecting the adoption is BIM users. Although studies in literature generally aim to measure how BIM adoption can be increased in different countries, none of these studies investigated whether there is a perspective difference on BIM use between BIM users according to occupational groups. In this context, this study has an attempt to develop a better understanding of architects and civil engineers’ perspective on BIM adoption factors in AEC industry. In line with the purpose, main factors affecting the BIM adoption in AEC industry were identified. Then, a survey was conducted with the participation of a total of 150 BIM users. Mean score and independent t-test were performed to explore rankings of BIM adoption factors and the perception differences between architects and civil engineers respectively.

abstract = {The exponential growth of the internet and inter-connectivity has resulted in an extensive increase in network size and the corresponding data, which has led to numerous novel attacks that pose significant challenges to network security. However, conventional network security approaches predominantly rely on the metadata of network traffic, utilized in numeric form, which is becoming ineffective against new attacks that hide within the content of the traffic. Therefore, it raises the need for security systems to adapt to the changing dynamics of network attacks. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called SeNet-I that leverages computer vision capabilities to combine low-level features and develop a more abstract and high-level representation of network traffic without requiring feature engineering. The proposed approach utilizes the raw network traffic information and transforms it into serialized three-channel images, which are employed as input to a proposed deep concatenated convolutional neural network model. Additionally, SeNet-I can easily incorporate packet level information, which is often challenging for conventional approaches due to its high dimensionality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we tested SeNet-I on both packet-based and flow-based network traffic, comparing it with current state-of-the-art methods and different image-based approaches. With F1 scores of 96% and 83% achieved in the multi-class classification of flow-based and packet-based network intrusion detection, our proposed approach outperformed other existing methods in the literature. Lastly, we discussed the advantages and limitations of the proposed method.}

This paper presents a systematic literature review on the subject, and systematizes the key technologies and their time evolution in electrical power substations, incorporating bibliometric and content analyses from a sample of 253 suitable articles. A four-stage technological evolution model is proposed, classifying substation automation technologies from conventional to fully digital smart substations, comparing key hardware, software, and management characteristics between generations. The analysis reveals growing interest in the field; that the standard IEC 61850 is a critical enabler of digital substations; and that, despite frequent technical breakthroughs reports, few contextual studies investigate the benefits of smart substations. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive academic understanding of the topic, identifies key research trends, and can also support the electricity industry's professional practice to better plan and operate substations.}

abstract = {This literature review examines empirical research on smart technologies in eight domains and seeks to analyse implications for smart rural communities research. The development and implementation of smart technologies has the potential to improve various aspects of life in rural areas, including healthcare, mobility, and governance. However, the adoption of these technologies also raises important questions about their relation to communities. The existing literature is reviewed to examine the key findings and knowledge gaps. By using a sociotechnical perspective and considering the specific characteristics of rural communities, the discussion is focused on how smart technologies can contribute to rural contexts. Further, policy implications are considered, encompassing the requirement for a holistic and inclusive approach to the implementation of smart technologies in rural areas. Implementation should address the specific needs, challenges, economic and infrastructural conditions, social structures, and cultural contexts of the respective communities. Future research and exploration of smart community concepts in rural contexts are suggested to improve smart technology implementation.}

The present research contributes to this gap by investigating the benefits of AI for sustainable businesses. Qualitative content analysis was used to investigate twenty-five of the largest Finnish enterprises. In the years 2017–2021, AI was employed in twenty of these enterprises, sixteen of which relied on AI to obtain benefits associated with sustainable business practices. Based on the sample, AI can be perceived as a generalizing technology in Finland. Additionally, the strategic significance of AI for enterprises has been discovered to be increasing. The research results indicate that AI deployment was driven primarily by two interlinked aims: 1) optimization and 2) the pursuit of benefits in various dimensions of sustainable business.}

The study identifies key elements associated with the incorporation of green spaces and smart technologies within smart cities. The findings show that green spaces can promote environmental sustainability in smart cities when utilized as renewable energy sources, natural filters, and public spaces. However, effectively managing green spaces requires the implementation of smart technologies such as sensors to monitor and analyze data on factors such as air pollution, temperature, and irrigation levels. The study evaluates the challenges of green space data analysis such as cost, data reliability, privacy, and expertise, and reveals that Western and Eastern cities take different approaches to green space data analysis, focusing on environmental/social and urban planning benefits respectively. The importance of technologies and policies aimed at addressing environmental issues in disadvantaged communities, including air pollution, is emphasized. Effective strategies such as the deployment of air quality sensors, green infrastructure, and transit-oriented development can improve air quality and health, though success depends on policy design, resources, and infrastructure. Furthermore, the study explores the potential of advanced technologies and strategies to manage sustainable energy resources in smart cities, including smart grids, renewable energy, and energy-efficient buildings. The study also discusses the potential of smart technologies such as precision irrigation, smart metering, and waste management initiatives to reduce water usage and waste. The study concludes that technology and policy innovation can converge to yield environmental wellbeing through efficiency and reduced harm. By embracing sustainability, communities can lead in creating livable smart cities. The findings offer insights for policymakers, planners, and researchers on managing natural resources and promoting sustainable development in smart cities.}

On the other hand, Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs) are another fuzzy set extension reflecting the hesitancy of decision-makers in a wider area. The main target of this study is to develop a new fuzzy set extension, decomposed Pythagorean fuzzy sets (DPFSs) in order to utilize the properties of DFSs and PFSs together. First, the basic principles and mathematical operators of the DPFSs are developed with their proofs. Then, a new fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method, DPF- Combinative Distance based Assessment (CODAS) is developed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the DPF extension. The developed method is handled in the strategy selection problem for Internet of Things (IoT)-based sustainable supply chain systems. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis is performed on both the criteria weights and the decision makers' weights to verify the stability and effectiveness of the obtained results. In addition, a comparative analysis with decomposed fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Pythagorean fuzzy CODAS and Pythagorean fuzzy TOPSIS methods is presented to show the validity, superiority and advantages of the developed method.}

Literature suggests that I4.0 assists the firm in mitigating SCRs by enhancing its capability and competence. However, due to SCRs associated with I4.0, building only capability and competence does not necessarily help the firm to improve its resilience from any uncertain fluctuations in ex-post net profit from the long-term return. Therefore, it is essential to investigate how a risk-averse firm makes an optimal investment decision in implementing I4.0 when SCRs impair capability and competence, where we determine a firm’s optimal investment decision in terms of utility defined over the expected value and variance of its ultimate random profit from investing in I4.0. This study employs a mean-variance decision-theoretic model to examine I4.0 investment risk-return trade-offs under uncertainties stemming from two types of SCRs, namely system and operational risks, influencing the firm’s capability and competence achievements, respectively. The model demonstrates that under certain sufficiency conditions on the relative risk-return trade-offs, higher variation in capability or competence, or greater congruency between the SCRs, may lead to a lower optimal investment decision in I4.0. However, the optimal investment may increase with higher expected capability or competence for a given level of these SCRs. Finally, we conduct a simulation of the theoretical model, using vignette-based experimental data as the benchmark parameter values, to quantify the predictive ability and analytical merits of our model by identifying risk-return trade-offs.}

However, existing typical biometric authentication technologies exhibit limitations related to usability, time efficiency, and notably, the long-term viability of the method. Recent technological advancements have led to the development of specific devices capable of reproducing human biometrics due to their visibility and tactile nature. Consequently, there is a demand for a new biometric method to address the limitations of current authentication systems. Human brain signals have been utilized in various Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. Nevertheless, this approach also faces challenges related to usability, time efficiency, and most importantly, the stability of the method over time. Studies reveal that the stability of brain patterns poses a significant challenge in EEG-based authentication techniques. Stability refers to the capacity to withstand changes or disruptions, while permanency implies a lasting and unchanging state. Notably, stability can be temporary and subject to fluctuations, whereas permanency suggests a more enduring condition. Research demonstrates that utilizing alpha brainwaves is a superior option for authentication compared to other brainwave types. Many brain states lack stability in different situations. Interestingly, deep breathing can enhance alpha waves irrespective of the brain's current state. To explore the potential of utilizing deep breathing as a security pattern for authentication purposes, an experiment was conducted to investigate its effects on brain activity and its role in enhancing alpha brainwaves. By focusing on bolstering the permanency of brain patterns, our aim is to address the challenges associated with stability in EEG-based authentication techniques. The experimental results exhibited a high success rate of 91 % and 90 % for Support Vector Machine and Neural Network classifiers, respectively. These results suggest that deep breathing not only enhances permanency but could also serve as a suitable option for a brainwave-based authentication method.}

The proposed encryption method combines four phases: dual hyperchaotic, improved logistic map (ILM), Josephus traversing, and a hash function. The first and second phases utilize improved Chen and Lorentz systems-based 3D patterns to enhance confusion and diffusion. In the third phase, bit-plane permutations are performed through Josephus traversing in three directions: x, y, and z. Lastly, the fourth phase implements diffusion based on ILM to optimize encryption performance. The integration of a hash function in this method serves to heighten key sensitivity. The test results demonstrate the method's exceptional performance across various analyses, including statistical, differential, brute-force, and NIST test suite assessments. Additionally, the proposed method outperforms previous approaches significantly, as indicated by the majority assessment.}

While the roll-out represents a substantial effort in introducing digital devices into the residential sector, concerns persist about its effectiveness, also due to potential societal disruptions. Through in-depth interviews with experts (N = 17) and citizens (N = 23) and content-oriented analysis, the research unveils evolving pathways between ever more disengaged two grand narratives and value systems: energy as a commodity and energy as a common good. The first opts for technological progress, changing consumer behavior, to address energy poverty and social justice, building on market-based instruments and new business models. Conversely, the second harbors skepticism towards technological fixes, emphasizes energy sufficiency and questions energy opulence, linked to environmental justice considerations, and calling for corrective principles by regulatory means. Finally, the paper presents a conceptual framework to re-shape deep deliberative transformation, highlighting the importance of re-connecting to defined values, re-generating actionable knowledge, restructuring institutions in societal experimentation, and recognizing underlying processes such as justice claims.

abstract = {The Internet of Things has allowed for the connectivity of medical imaging devices to the healthcare sector's data backbone. This development, made possible by the IoT, will speed up the diagnosis and treatment phases of medical care. The increasing reliance on interconnected devices and cloud-based systems creates potential entry points for cyber-attacks and unauthorized access to sensitive medical data which not only jeopardize patient privacy but also have serious implications for patient safety and trust in healthcare systems. Medical images are critical assets in healthcare, and their confidentiality, integrity, and availability are paramount for accurate diagnoses, treatment planning, and patient care. This instigated research related to medical image security in IoT healthcare. For this, we investigated the usage of a cryptography-based network for image encryption and decryption, and its potential application to the safe transmission of medical images through deep learning. In the proposed work, we use a key learning network based on the ResNet-50 architecture to do the mapping between various image representations. Due to the incorporation of these “hidden properties” into the learning model, the encryption technique can be fine-tuned for each specific domain. As a first step in decryption, we use reconstructive networks to convert the encrypted image back into its “plaintext” form. Once the hidden entities have been uncovered, a Return on Investment (ROI) framework can be made available, and data mining can be simplified by drawing directly from the user's local information environment. Imaging tools for gauging therapy is a highly reliable by using the proposed system. We used two different kinds of publicly available datasets, and that helped us succeed in our mission. The comprehensive empirical setup and the findings of the security analysis suggest that the suggested method may give an unprecedented level of security and an unprecedentedly powerful outcome.}

Today, we face similar challenges and opportunities with the metaverse as we try to discover how to attract, enable, serve, and capture value from users in the virtual world. In this article, we introduce the concept of a metaverse realm (i.e., a specific type of metaverse space and community) and present the metaverse honeycomb model to explain the functionalities and affordances for different metaverse realms. We present two applications of the honeycomb model to show how shifting attention to immersive functionalities can characterize various metaverse realms. To conclude, we outline how the model could be used to strategically evaluate metaverse realms in terms of their external fit (i.e., the who-what-how of realms), internal fit (i.e., the trade-offs and synergies of realm functionalities), and life cycles (i.e., roadmapping and directing realm evolution).}

abstract = {The emergence of fintech services in the insurance industry has been a transformative force, reshaping how insurance companies operate, how policies are sold, and how customers interact with their insurers. Financial technology developments, also known as "fintech," are changing how financial services are offered, presenting novel possibilities for the insurance industry worldwide. However, in the Malaysian insurance and takaful industry a good number of customers are still dependent on conventional channels like agents and brokers continue to be important sources for purchases and payments related to insurance instead of using Fintech services. The insurance industry's success and growth are highly dependent on adopting technological services offered by companies to make the process efficient and profitable. So, this study aimed to empirically identify the determinants influencing Malaysia's insurance and takaful industry customers to accept the fintech services for insurance-related transactions and activities. The research combined two prominent technology adoption models UTAUT2, and Delone and Mclean IS Success, and proposed a new research framework. The data for the research has been collected from the insurance and takaful industry customers through Google Forms. Finally, 350 responses were received. The PLS-SEM method was utilized to investigate the data by Smart PLS 3.2.9 software. The result of the study revealed that effort expectancy, information quality, service quality, system quality, and perceived risk impact behavioral intention to use fintech services (BI). In addition, the actual use of fintech services is impacted by behavioral intention. Nevertheless, no impact was found in the case of performance expectancy and social influence on BI. The findings of the study are helpful for academicians, researchers, and insurance companies to explore determinants for fintech services acceptance.}

This study examines the conflict's impacts on the local and global digital ecosystem. Using grey literature, we analyzed English-language data sources primarily published between November 2022 and April 2023, which were based on data sources from the commencement of the conflict to the publication date. The investigation reveals insights into four categories: cyber and kinetic warfare, telecommunications, IT and cloud computing, digital geopolitics and resilience. The main insight in cyber warfare is that cyber attacks on Ukraine's digital infrastructure were only partially effective despite the massive involvement of cybercrime groups implementing adaptive wiping and DDoS attacks on behalf of national interests. The cyber defense success resulted from the allies' support for Ukraine and a well-established and implemented national cybersecurity strategy. Kinetic attacks against data centers have accelerated the migration of data and applications to cloud computing. The most incredible legacy of the current conflict is the positive paradigm shift in the cloud's security and privacy capabilities for sensitive systems' continuous operation as an alternative to system disability in locally destroyed data centers. The third insight reveals Telecom's reliance on satellite network suppliers and mobile power equipment, such as High-Capacity batteries, which are in shortage worldwide. Digital geopolitics alters the paradigms of digital resilience. Global tech companies assume the role of digital nations and superpowers while taking sides. During the conflict, we observe for the first time in practice the digital blockade by global techies of one side of the conflict and the digital support of the other, thereby shaping paradigms regarding digital sovereignty as digital resilience.}

It investigates the influence of different pandemic waves on these firms, taking into account their size and location, to gain valuable insights into their crisis management strategies. Using a micro‐level database made up of 1,096 Moroccan firms observed during the initial three waves of the pandemic, we extract data from the World Bank ‘Enterprise Survey: impact on firms’ database. Our analysis, using a logit model, reveals that the impact of the pandemic varied by the gender of the firm head and survey period. Female‐led firms were more severely affected by the health crisis compared with their male peers. The quick application of policy adaptations played a crucial role in reducing the impact of the health crisis on male‐led enterprises. Small firms, particularly those situated in regions such as Beni Mellal‐Khenifra, Drâa‐Tafilalet, Oriental, and Marrakech‐Safi, have been significantly affected by the COVID‐19 crisis. This study makes two key contributions. Firstly, it provides an empirical analysis of the pandemic's impact on Moroccan firms using enterprise‐level data, which is unprecedented in Morocco. Secondly, it investigates the repercussions of the pandemic on female‐led Moroccan firms of varying sizes and regions, acknowledging the disproportionate impact on women during economic crises. The study aims to offer valuable insights for supporting the recovery of female‐led firms in the future. Our findings emphasize the importance of targeted assistance for small firms and those located in affected regions to mitigate the crisis's consequences and promote economic revival. These businesses play a crucial role in the local economy, and supporting their survival and resilience in the post‐COVID‐19 era is essential.
Resumen
Este estudio examina los efectos de la pandemia causada por el coronavirus 2019 (COVID‐19) en las empresas marroquíes dirigidas por mujeres, para lo cual considera tanto las repercusiones a corto como a largo plazo. En él se investiga la influencia en estas empresas de las distintas oleadas de la pandemia, teniendo en cuenta su tamaño y ubicación, para obtener valiosas perspectivas sobre sus estrategias de gestión de crisis. Se partió de una base de datos a nivel micro constituida por 1.096 empresas marroquíes observadas durante las tres oleadas iniciales de la pandemia, y con ella se extrajeron datos de la base de datos ‘Enterprise Survey: impact on firms’ del Banco Mundial. El análisis utilizó un modelo logit y mostró que el impacto de la pandemia varió en función del género del jefe de la empresa y del periodo de la encuesta. Las empresas dirigidas por mujeres se vieron más afectadas por la crisis sanitaria que las dirigidas por hombres. La rápida aplicación de adaptaciones políticas desempeñó un papel crucial en la reducción del impacto de la crisis sanitaria sobre las empresas dirigidas por hombres. Las pequeñas empresas, sobre todo las situadas en regiones como Beni Mellal‐Khenifra, Drâa‐Tafilalet, Oriental y Marrakech‐Safi, se vieron muy afectadas por la crisis del COVID‐19. Este estudio aporta dos contribuciones clave. En primer lugar, ofrece un análisis empírico del impacto de la pandemia en las empresas marroquíes utilizando datos a nivel de empresa, algo sin precedentes en Marruecos. En segundo lugar, investiga las repercusiones de la pandemia en las empresas marroquíes de distintos tamaños y regiones dirigidas por mujeres, y reconoce el impacto desproporcionado en las mujeres durante las crisis económicas. El estudio trata de ofrecer aportaciones valiosas para apoyar la recuperación de las empresas dirigidas por mujeres en el futuro. Los resultados subrayan la importancia de la ayuda específica a las pequeñas empresas y a las situadas en las regiones afectadas para mitigar las consecuencias de la crisis y fomentar la reactivación económica. Estas empresas desempeñan un papel crucial en la economía local, por lo que es esencial apoyar su supervivencia y resiliencia en la era posterior a COVID‐19.
抄録
本稿では、新型コロナウイルス感染症(COVID‐19)のパンデミックがモロッコの女性主導の企業に与えた影響を、短期的および長期的の両方のインパクトを考慮して検討する。この調査では、これらの企業の規模と立地を考慮して、危機管理戦略に関する重要な見識を得るために、パンデミックの波がこれらの企業に与える影響を検討する。パンデミックの最初の3つの波の間にモロッコの1,096の企業から得られたデータから成るマイクロレベルのデータベースを使用して、World Bank Enterprise SurveyのImpact on firmsデータベースからデータを抽出する。ロジットモデルを用いた我々の分析から、企業トップの性別と調査期間によってパンデミックの影響が異なることが明らかになった。女性主導の企業は、男性主導の企業と比較して、健康危機の影響がより深刻であった。男性主導の企業では、政策の適応を迅速に行うことが、健康危機の影響を減らす上で重要な役割を果たした。特にベニ・メラル=ヘニフラ、ドラア=タフィラレット、オリアンタル、マラケシュ=サフィなどの地域にある小規模企業は、COVID‐19危機の影響を大きく受けている。本研究の主な貢献は2つある。1つは、企業レベルのデータを用いてモロッコ企業に対するパンデミックの影響の実証分析を行ったが、これはモロッコでは前例のないことである。2つめは、様々な規模または立地が異なる女性主導のモロッコ企業に対するパンデミックの影響の調査から、経済危機における女性に対して偏った影響があることが認められた。本研究は、将来の女性主導の企業の回復を支援するための重要な見識を得ることを目的としている。我々の調査結果から、危機の影響を緩和し経済復興を促進するために、小規模企業や被害を受けた地域に立地する企業を対象とした支援の重要性が強調される。これらの企業は地域経済において重要な役割を果たしており、ポストコロナの時代にこれらの企業が存続し回復する支援をすることが不可欠である。}

IIoT enables wide-scope data collection and utilisation, and reduces errors, increases efficiency, and provides an improved understanding of the process in return. While this novel solution is the pillar of Industry 4.0, the inherent operational complexity of bioprocessing arising from the involvement of living systems or their components in manufacturing renders the sector a challenging one for the implementation of IIoT. A large segment of the industry comprises the manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals and advanced therapies, some of the most valuable biotechnological products available, which undergo tight regulatory evaluations and scrutinization from product conceptualisation to patient delivery. Extensive process understanding is what biopharmaceutical industry strives for, however, the complexity of transition into a new mode of operation, potential misalignment of priorities, the need for substantial investments to facilitate transition, the limitations imposed by the downtime required for transition and the essentiality of regulatory support, render it challenging for the industry to adopt IIoT solutions to integrate with biomanufacturing operations. There is currently a need for universal solutions that would streamline the implementation of IIoT and overcome the widespread reluctance observed in the sector, which will recommend accessible implementation strategies, effective employee training and offer valuable insights in return to advance any processing and manufacturing operation within their respective regulatory frameworks.}

This article focuses on urban practices of walking, driving and ride-hailing with mobile technologies and their failures on an everyday basis in urban Guangzhou (a megacity in south China), based on an analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data collected from the fieldwork in 2021. It finds that digitally mediated mobilities can be seen as everyday digital practices which are simultaneously produced and reproduced through everyday encounters with platforms and their breakdowns, places, and people's knowledge, skills, and imaginations in both digital and physical spaces. Moreover, digital platforms, as well as their failures, affect daily mobilities in contradictory ways. On the one hand, digital platforms mediate and reshape the time-space of people's daily mobilities and make people adjust and adapt their practices to the logic of platforms. While on the other hand, they allow people to creatively produce valuable data for themselves and enhance their skills of re-organising their mobilities with smartphone apps efficiently. These findings can advance digital geographies' understanding of the complex, contingent and messy relations between digital platforms, urban spaces and everyday practices.}

This paper proposes a dynamic probabilistic risk assessment method for electric grid cybersecurity risk analysis. The proposed method helps reduce the reliance on expert judgment, capture a broad range of components and system dynamics, and model the interactions between various contributing entities (e.g., attacker, operator). In addition, the scenarios with multiple events, such as the occurrence of both cyberattacks and failures of physical components, the occurrence of both cyberattacks and operators’ (in)correct reactions, are considered and analyzed. For each cyberattack scenario, Monte Carlo simulations are used to obtain possible sequences of the system's evolution under study and then derive risk estimates. As an application of the proposed method, the risk assessment method serves as the basis of risk-informed defense resource allocation to improve electric grid cybersecurity. The proposed method is verified using the IEEE 14-bus system by evaluating different security resource allocations for selected cyberattack scenarios.}

We find significant volatility spillovers, especially when the frequency and the magnitude of cyberattacks rise. While this suggests the presence of informational inefficiencies, these are not uniformly distributed, as the observed heterogeneity in volatility spillovers depends on the size of the cyberattack. Moreover, cyberattacks appear to change the network structure of Bitcoin trading platforms. Specifically, while the Bitcoin in U.S. dollar platform remains systemically important, the Bitcoin trading platforms of the Yen and Australian dollar have become more relevant in recent times. From a practitioner and market professional perspective, our results suggest that an informed investment strategy can exploit such volatility spillovers to generate abnormal returns. From a policy point of view, the easing of Bitcoin regulation in Asia seems to be linked with the increasingly prominent importance of the trading platforms of the Yen and Australian dollar.}

The ‘AI Liability Directive’ contains rules on the disclosure of information and the alleviation of the burden of proof in relation to damage caused by AI systems. The ‘revised Product Liability Directive’ substantially modifies the current product liability regime by broadening the scope, integrating new circumstances to assess the product's defectiveness and introducing provisions regarding presumptions of defectiveness and causation. In this article, we evaluate how both proposals provide some answers to major technological developments – in particular AI – in view of the issues they raise as identified in the legal literature. To do so, we also provide a clear understanding of the major provisions in both proposals, supported by visuals. Although we welcome both proposals for several reasons outlined in the article, different unclarities and inconsistencies need to be resolved. These inter alia relate to the unclarity of terms, the position of claimants, the uncertain interaction with other supranational initiatives and the many interpretation issues with regard to the fault-based liability regime. A more fundamental objection relates to the choice of the revised Product Liability Directive to capture all liability issues with AI systems, which comes at the cost of losing the connection to ‘product’ as a grounding concept. Our findings can be used by policymakers in further adapting and refining both proposals to the digital reality.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) brings great potential but also risks to the electricity industry. Following the EU's current regulatory proposal, the EU Regulation for Artificial Intelligence (AI Act), there will be direct, potentially adverse effects on companies of the electricity industry in Europe and beyond, as well as those active in the development of AI systems. In this paper, we develop a replicable framework for estimating compliance costs for different electricity market agents that will need to comply with the numerous requirements the AI Act imposes. The electricity systems of Austria, Greece and Switzerland are used as case-studies. We estimate annual, aggregated costs for electricity market agents ranging from less than one million to almost 200 million Euros per country, depending on compliance costs scenarios. Results suggest that a profit growth of 10% through AI utilization is needed to offset the highest added compliance cost of the AI Act on electricity market agents. Eventually, we further show how to assess the regional differences of these costs added to system operation, providing spatially disaggregated compliance costs estimates that consider the structural differences of the electricity industry within 26 Swiss cantons.}

abstract = {This paper deals with the issue of ensuring the reliability of microsystems in the modern-day development of digital control technologies. The use of digital technologies to manage the reliability of microsystems stems from the development of various modern energy technologies with complex structures that require enhanced management systems to ensure their reliability. In this paper, we propose the use of digital platforms to manage the reliability of microsystems. The way digital platforms function makes it possible to automate the process of collecting, processing, and storing the necessary information about both power equipment and the operating modes of distribution networks and, in so doing, to assess and ensure the reliability of microsystems at all stages of the life cycle. In this paper, we present the main operational characteristics and principles of digital platforms. To analyze the reliability of microsystems within the framework of the functioning of digital platforms, we propose the use of machine learning methods. We suggest two algorithms for assessing the reliability of microsystems. In the first algorithm, the model is trained to analyze the regime indicators of the microsystem and, on the basis of these, to determine the reliability indicators. In the second algorithm, the model is trained to immediately determine the reliability indicators of the microsystem. Practical results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of the speed of assessing the reliability of microsystems while maintaining the required accuracy of calculations.}

abstract = {While the significance of Hotel Digital Capability (HDC) has been acknowledged in the literature, limited attention has been given to its measurement. This study endeavors to identify the dimensions of HDC and construct a reliable measurement scale. A combined approach of qualitative and quantitative methods across three studies was employed to achieve the research objectives. Study 1, grounded in interviews, delineated HDC as a multidimensional construct encompassing digital basic capability, digital integration capability, digital application capability, and digital optimization capability. Building on the four-factor model identified in Study 1, Study 2 formulated an 18-item scale with robust measurement properties. Additionally, the second-order structure, incorporating four first-order factors, received empirical support. Subsequently, Study 3 sought to validate the scale and ascertain its nomological validity. The developed HDC scale lays the groundwork for future investigations into digital capability and transformation within the hotel industry.}

abstract = {The successful adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies by firms requires them to formulate a digital strategy and implementation roadmap. An established approach to assess firms’ needs towards digitalization is through maturity models. While there is a large number of maturity models in the literature, they present several limitations related to their generalizability and theoretical foundations. Our study aims to build and empirically validate an Industry 4.0 digital maturity model, based on the Technology-Organization-Environment framework. We conducted a systematic literature review of 55 digital maturity models, which we synthesized to create an integrated digital maturity assessment model. We tested our model through a focus group with industry experts and 24 companies from various manufacturing sectors. Our review suggests that existing digital maturity models have underestimated the relevance of the Environment dimension. Our empirical data suggests that companies often invest in digital technologies without considering critical organizational and environmental constraints.}
