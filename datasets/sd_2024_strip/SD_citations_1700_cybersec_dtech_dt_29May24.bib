abstract = {Driven by business strategies, digital transformation (DT) facilitates dramatic change in air passenger behavior. This study aims to determine and analyze different DT strategies (DTSs) with the help of an integrated SWOT-based fuzzy AHP-MARCOS methodology that is proposed for the first time in the literature for this purpose. This methodology is validated with a case study concerning the airline industry in Turkey. The weights of the SWOT factors are determined with the fuzzy AHP method. The fuzzy MARCOS approach is used to select the most suitable DTS. The most appropriate strategy is obtained as “focusing on differentiated digital customer experience and service quality by the adaptation of business models to DT to provide benefits”.}

abstract = {Digital technologies are increasingly changing the nature of competition and generating externalities that impact society. On the one hand, digitalization allows organizations to create substantial economic value in shorter periods of time through improved economies of scale, scope, and learning, resulting is increasing returns on capital and competitive concentration. On the other hand, ensuing societal concerns with inequities, regulatory lapses, and lack of transparency and truthfulness represent significant challenges for effective corporate governance. This article addresses the consequences to stakeholders that emerge from the digital economy, discussing how traditional governance mechanisms are ill-equipped to subvert negative externalities. We offer a stewardship-based model of corporate governance as a solution to the pressing problems plaguing consumers, employees, and other salient stakeholders of digital business excesses, with an emphasis on truthful disclosures, enhanced transparency, improvements in equitable allocation of organizational resources, and heightened trust relationships. The focus is on the positive role that organizational leaders can play as exemplars of virtuous stewardship in a highly networked society. The article redefines a modern view of stewardship in a digital economy and applies its principles to the four Ts of virtuous stewardship, a practical corporate governance model that encompasses truthfulness, transparency, trust, and technological equity.}

After several years of administrative reforms inspired by New Public Management and New Public Governance, local governments may be ready to adopt IoT-based solutions to gain efficiency, improve public service experiences and actively engage citizens in public policy. We propose an original theoretical approach to explain the adoption of this innovation by local governments by integrating adoption factors resulting from the technological attributes of the innovation and those resulting from the appropriation of a technology whose uses are socially constructed by local government leaders under institutional pressure resulting from administrative reforms. The study is based on a sample of 247 French leaders of cities with a population between 15,000 and 150,000. While the advantage in terms of optimization encourages the adoption of IoT technology, its complexity and risks of data leaks discourage it. Decision-makers in line with administrative reforms may decide to adopt IoT technology to improve efficiency, quality of services, and citizen participation. If human experiences in implementing new technologies facilitate IoT adoption, trust in this new technology helps overcome fears about the complexity of the technology and potential data leaks.}

abstract = {The demand for palm oil production has been disrupted and volatilized due to uncertain conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. To overcome this problem, Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has been introduced to facilitate the operation and production management process. However, the palm oil industry needs to address sustainability issues. Therefore, the circular economy (CE) is the best solution. By deploying I4.0 in the CE, the palm oil industry, a multimillion-dollar industry, is expected to improve its operations and production and achieve sustainability in the near future. However, to benefit from advanced I4.0 in the CE, it is important to assess the drivers that cause the evolution and dissemination of these technologies. By considering the importance of I4.0 in the CE, this study aims to investigate the drivers of I4.0 in the CE and the nexus between them from an ecological modernization theory perspective. This study uses a combined approach based on the Delphi technique, fuzzy decision-making trials and evaluation laboratory methods to analyse the driving forces of I4.0 in the CE. The results show 17 driving criteria in the cause group and 13 criteria in the effect group. In particular, information for practitioners, cybersecurity, improving real-time, economic attractiveness, laws and policy and energy recovery are the most powerful criteria that can influence the other criteria, especially the criteria in the effect group. Overall, this study contributes theoretical and practical insights, as well as policy implications. The study's findings will help firms clarify the connectivity between the significant drivers of I4.0 in the CE, especially in the palm oil industry, which is valuable in the development of congruent solutions for inducing sustainable development. Finally, this study suggests that a wide range of integration and connectivity effects on I4.0 in the CE allow for an improvement in the overall performance, including operations and production, by adopting a holistic approach.}

abstract = {Agricultural digitization is revolutionizing food production with promises to increase both yield and environmental sustainability through the reduction of chemical inputs. However, it is unclear whether the adoption of digital agricultural technologies can also play a role in preventing or reducing food loss and waste. Examples of technologies used in food loss and waste reduction include ‘smart packaging’ that changes colour as food spoils, or Blockchain and radio-frequency identification tags that track information to identify potential sources of contamination along the food supply chain. Here, a systematic literature review was conducted to investigate the role of digital agricultural technologies in enabling food loss and waste prevention/reduction or lack thereof from a global perspective. To explore the digital agricultural technologies-food loss and waste dynamics, this review employed four conceptual frameworks relevant to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 12 and Target 12.3 to foster responsible consumption and production patterns and to halve per capita food waste respectively by 2030. The four frameworks include (i) environmental sustainability, (ii) economic efficiency, (iii) social equity, and (iv) substantive governance and policies. The review findings demonstrate that prohibitive investment costs and the digital divide between technology adaptors limit the wide uptake of digital agricultural technologies. Where adoptions were evident, the rationale to do so was centered on boosting economic gains, reducing food production costs, and/or alleviating food insecurity. Food loss and waste prevention was rarely the principal technology adoption driver. The dynamics between digital agricultural technologies and food loss and waste prevention deserve rigorous examination to support practical policy options that invigorate sustainable food systems.}

abstract = {Over the last few years, there has been a steady increase in smart home technology's pervasiveness, to the degree where consumer IoT is part of many homes. As our homes become complex cyber-physical spaces, the risk to our physical security from attacks originating in cyberspace becomes much more significant. Within the literature, there is much discussion about the technical vulnerabilities within the smart home. However, this is often not linked to a rich understanding of how an attacker could exploit them. In this paper, we focus on residential burglary and develop a rich understanding of the process by which residential burglary is committed and the effect of the smart home on this process. By combining two areas of the academic literature, residential burglary and smart-home security, this paper provides an academically grounded discussion that places the nascent vulnerabilities associated with the smart-home into the context of the process by which burglary is committed. The commission of residential burglary is a complex decision-making process, which the public often simplifies into planned or unplanned crimes; this is a dangerous oversimplification. The analysis identifies some increased risk during the target selection stage phase. However, in the short term, residential burglars are unlikely to exploit smart home technology routinely.}

As the nuclear fleet continues to adopt digital instrumentation and control systems, it is increasingly important to have effective and efficient cyber risk analysis techniques to support risk management decisions, such as risk elimination by system redesign or risk mitigation by implementation of prioritized security controls. To understand the state of the art in cyber risk analysis for future research, we surveyed 36 publications across ten application domains. We describe our survey methodology and rate each technique based upon scope, adoptability, and repeatability. We examine the unique constraints of the nuclear industry and outline the strengths and weaknesses of using the cyber risk analysis techniques in the industry, highlighting gaps with current techniques. We also discuss challenges and potential research directions for advancing the science for both existing and new advanced reactors.}

The objective of this article was to examine the determinants of internet access, use and productive uses for school-age children in households of different socioeconomic levels. The Heckman selection model was estimated based on data taken from the Encuesta Nacional sobre Disponibilidad y Uso de Tecnologías de la Información en los Hogares (ENDUTIH or National Survey on the Availability and Use of Information Technologies in the Household) 2018. The results obtained show that the probability of having children internet accessing and usage patterns (homework, courses, and blogs) depends on level of schooling, economic status, digital skills, and place of residence, as well as the presence of electronic devices and infomediaries in the household. These findings suggest the urgent need to redesign current ICT policy with a long-term integrated vision that guarantees access to ICTs and their productive use for students immersed in an ecosystem of educational innovation for the XXI century.}

This study aims to identify the important barriers to the adoption of IoT in the circular economy in the manufacturing sector. To this end, a survey study was conducted to construct a framework for the evaluation of the IoT adoption barriers in the circular economy. Therefore, a novel method integrating the Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) methods based on Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets (PFSs) was proposed. In this method, the SWARA model is used to estimate the significance degree or weighting degrees of the barriers, while the CoCoSo method is applied to ranking various organizations in the manufacturing sector under the identified barriers. To show the performance of the developed approach, a comparison analysis is performed of the selection of qualified organizations. The outcome of this study indicated that the developed approach was able to suggest more realistic performance under PFSs, hence providing a wide range of applications.}

With much effort directed towards merchant shipping, technical designs for urban ferries are also under development to facilitate smart mobility. Safety perceptions of such autonomous ferries are likely important drivers of the adoption of such novel technologies. Understanding the public’s perceived benefits and concerns can support policy makers and industry in implementing responsible risk governance and can have design and operational implications. This article explores this topic for a hypothetical autonomous urban ferry in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Through phone surveys and interviews, focus is on safety perceptions of different automation degrees, which are further explored in relation to selected population characteristics. Improved environmental performance is the most important perceived benefit, whereas safety is the most important concern. Overall, there is support for increased automation, but an on-board presence of qualified operators is considered important for safety and security related reasons. Remotely controlled ferries without onboard personnel or fully autonomous vessels are generally perceived as (very) unsafe. Men are slightly more favourable of increased automation than women, as are people with more digital knowledge and skills. Acknowledging several limitations of this exploratory study, of which the focus on older age groups in the studied population is the most significant, the findings suggest that understanding the public’s safety perceptions is important to ensure the successful design, implementation, and operation of autonomous urban, so that the envisaged benefits of these new systems can be achieved.}

abstract = {A series of recent developments highlight the increasingly important role of online platforms in impacting data privacy in today's digital economy. Revelations and parliamentary hearings about privacy violations in Facebook's app and service partner ecosystem, EU Court of Justice judgments on joint responsibility of platforms and platform users, and the rise of smartphone app ecosystems where app behaviour is governed by app distribution platforms and operating systems, all show that platform policies can make or break the enjoyment of privacy by users. In this article, we examine these developments and explore the question of what can and should be the role of platforms in protecting data privacy of their users. The article first distinguishes the different roles that platforms can have in ensuring respect for data privacy in relevant ecosystems. These roles include governing access to data, design of relevant interfaces and privacy mechanisms, setting of legal and technical standards, policing behaviour of the platform's (business) users, coordinating responsibility for privacy issues between platform users and the platform, and direct and indirect enforcement of a platform's data privacy standards on relevant players. At a higher level, platforms can also perform a role by translating different international regulatory requirements into platform policies, thereby facilitating compliance of apps in different regulatory environments. And in all of this, platforms are striking a balance between ensuring the respect for data privacy in data-driven environments on the one hand and optimization of the value and business opportunities connected to the platform and underlying data for users of the platform on the other hand. After this analysis of platforms’ roles in protecting privacy, the article turns to the question of what should this role be and how to better integrate platforms in the current legal frameworks for data privacy in Europe and the US. The article will argue for a compromise between direct regulation of platforms and mere self-regulation, in arguing that platforms should be required to make official disclosures about their privacy-related policies and practices for their respective ecosystems. These disclosures should include statements about relevant conditions for access to data and the platform, the platform's standards with respect to privacy and the way in which these standards ensure or facilitate compliance with existing legal frameworks by platform users, and statements with respect to the risks of abuse of different data sources and platform tools and actions taken to prevent or police such abuses. We argue that such integration of platforms in current regulatory frameworks is both feasible and desirable. It would make the role that platforms already have in practice more explicit. This would help to highlight best practices, create more accountability and could save significant regulatory and compliance resources in bringing relevant information together in one place. In addition, it could provide clarity for business users of platforms, who are now sometimes confronted with restrictive decisions by platforms in ways that lack transparency and oversight.}

For example, there is a substantial literature in energy social science on the role that the smart grid plays in the sustainable energy transition, and much of that research assumes continuity with a traditional centralized electric system, modified slightly to admit some distributed energy resources. We start from a different perspective. First, our focus is less on centralized generation and transmission companies and more on organizations that distribute electricity and related services to end customers in a defined geographic area. These entities are described in a variety of ways across countries; we use the term “local power organizations” (LPOs). Second, we focus less directly on the sustainability transition as such and more on the complex sociotechnical changes produced by specific digital tools. We open the black box of digital technologies that underpin the sustainability transition to highlight implicated sociotechnical issues, ranging from individual privacy to control and ownership of electricity. We then outline three central challenges of digitization that suggest new directions in energy social science research as the future control of electricity develops along its digital pathway.}

The integration of IoT technology in the Smart Grids is a critical way to accelerate the digitization of the power grid and is useful for the efficient performance of the energy grid infrastructure. For efficient real-time data analysis and decision-making, the Internet of Things will incorporate various communication systems seamlessly. To achieve efficient communication between all Internet of Things, devices are expected to use multiple means, including smart sensors, cable and wireless communication. Improved Internet of Things sensor technologies and connectivity could theoretically prevent or minimize the potential to natural disaster transmission lines, improve transmission power capacity and reduce economic losses. A smart grid is a variety of sensors, devices, and data sets that continuously capture high-resolution data equal to individual IoT conditions. A vast amount of data is one of the biggest challenges on the Internet of Things. Edge Computing is trying to process data close to linked sensors to address this problem, where the data is gathered and processed. This paper aims to investigate the edge computing solutions for the smart grid. A comprehensive review of both emerging issues and edge computing in the Smart Grid environment is discussed and explained. There are two primary components to the energy sharing process among Prosumers: information/digital technologies and Artificial Intelligence Scheduling Techniques. Each of them is mentioned in detail to discuss the Prosumer smart Grid. Furthermore, Edge Computing and classifications (cloudlet, Fog computing and Multi-Access) are among the suitable network methods mentioned in this paper.

abstract = {Understanding the future of multi-vector energy networks in the context of the transition to net zero and the energy trilemma (energy security, environmental impact and social cost) requires novel interdisciplinary approaches. A variety of challenges regarding systems, plant, physical infrastructure, sources and nature of uncertainties, technological in general and more specifically Information and Communication Technologies requirements, cyber security, big data analytics, innovative business models and markets, policy and societal changes, are critically important to ensure enhanced flexibility and higher resilience, as well as reduced costs of an integrated energy system. Integration of individual energy networks into multi-vector entities opens a number of opportunities, but also presents a number of challenges requiring interdisciplinary perspectives and solutions. Considering drivers like societal evolution, climate change and technology advances, this paper describes the most important aspects which have to be taken into account when designing, planning and operating future multi-vector energy networks. For this purpose, the issues addressing future architecture, infrastructure, interdependencies and interactions of energy network infrastructures are elaborated through a novel interdisciplinary perspective. Aspects related to optimal operation of multi-vector energy networks, implementation of novel technologies, jointly with new concepts and algorithms, are extensively discussed. The role of policy, markets and regulation in facilitating multi-vector energy networks is also reported. Last but not least, the aspects of risks and uncertainties, relevant for secure and optimal operation of future multi-vector energy networks are discussed.}

abstract = {Smart grids are the backbone of existing energy production and supply scenario in today’s society. Gradual increasing demand of energy has certainly emphasized the significance and provenance of reliability and predictive aspects over smart grids. Conventional smart grids under perform in terms of self-aware behavior, especially in delay tolerance, energy requirement, and dissemination of monitoring notions. Highly distributed geographical distribution sometimes cause problems for smart grids to provide necessary services to both the consumers and prosumers. Internet of Things (IoT) is thus integrated with smart grids to facilitate distributed monitoring services for smooth running of the smart grid. Although, IoT has remarkably supported smart grids to perform smarter than ever, it lacks in security, decentralization, transparency, and trust-less approaches. Thus, blockchain is envisaged to leverage minimizing such gaps and to pave new horizon in the blockchain-IoT enabled smart grid monitoring. In this paper, we investigate how blockchain and IoT together can improve existing smart grid ecosystem toward facilitation of better monitoring services. We do this via a Systematic Literature Review. Firstly, we present preliminaries behind the study, followed by in-depth review of different domains of IoT-based smart grid monitoring. Next, we discuss various attributes of blockchain-IoT derived smart grid management schemes. Then, we discuss possible opportunities and benefits of using blockchain with respect to blockchain-IoT based smart grid monitoring. Finally, we illustrate open research challenges and future directions in the aforementioned aspects. The article concludes that with certain changes in current blockchain technology, it can surely encompass the direction of enhanced monitoring of IoT based smart grid.}

Project leaders are required to implement and manage 4IR-related projects but do not necessarily have the required competencies. This is especially the case in a developing country such as South Africa. The study explored the digital competencies that are deemed important by project managers in managing projects in the digital economy. Q-methodology was used to determine potential perspectives, and three confirming perspectives and one emergent perspective were identified. The main competence deemed important is online communication and collaboration, whereas cybersecurity is deemed unimportant. This study is the first of its kind and provides insight into the digital intelligence of project leaders. It contributes to the current debate around the future digital competencies and skills that are required. It also provides guidelines for organisations on how to plan and structure training and to upskill their current project leaders. A concerted effort needs to be in place to upskill project leaders.

The concepts of information literacy and digital literacy related to academic librarianship were used as the basis for the self-efficacy and empowerment necessary to achieve individual success during digital changes in the academic community. We then checked how such a sense of empowerment among academics explains the presence of information culture in this community and different approaches to information management. The factors of information management and information use were presented as affecting a university's institutional readiness for the new requirements of digital transformation from the perspective of governance issues. The findings highlight that information literacy underlies academics' empowerment and a high level of self-efficacy driven by this literacy can also be indirectly translated into the formation of pro-active information culture that strengthens an academic's position in creating information use outcomes and by making them ready for digital transformation. Through information literacy outcomes the academic libraries can turn out to be an important transformative force in terms of digital changes at universities.}

Nowadays, open innovations such as intelligent automation and digitalization are being adopted by every industry with the help of powerful technology such as Artificial Intelligence (AI). This evolution drives systematic running processes, involves less overhead of managerial activities and increased production rate. However, it also gave birth to different kinds of attacks and security issues at the data storage level and process level. The real-life implementation of such AI-enabled intelligent systems is currently plagued by the lack of security and trust levels in system predictions. Blockchain is a prevailing technology that can help to alleviate the security risks of AI applications. These two technologies are complementing each other as Blockchain can mitigate vulnerabilities in AI, and AI can improve the performance of Blockchain. Many studies are currently being conducted on the applicability of Blockchains for securing intelligent applications in various crucial domains such as healthcare, finance, energy, government, and defense. However, this domain lacks a systematic study that can offer an overarching view of research activities currently going on in applying Blockchains for securing AI-based systems and improving their robustness. This paper presents a bibliometric and literature analysis of how Blockchain provides a security blanket to AI-based systems. Two well-known research databases (Scopus and Web of Science) have been examined for this analytical study and review. The research uncovered that idea proposals in conferences and some articles published in journals make a major contribution. However, there is still a lot of research work to be done to implement real and stable Blockchain-based AI systems.}

abstract = {The COVID-19 outbreak, which emerged in China and continues to spread rapidly all over the world, has brought with it increasing numbers of cases and deaths. Governments have suffered serious damage and losses not only in the field of health but also in many other fields. This has directed governments to adopt and implement various strategies in their communities. However, only a few countries succeed partially from the strategies implemented while other countries have failed. In this context, it is necessary to identify the most important strategy that should be implemented by governments. A decision problem based on the decisions of many experts, with some contradictory and multiple criteria, should be taken into account in order to evaluate the multiple strategies implemented by various governments. In this study, this decision process is considered as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem that also takes into account uncertainty. For this purpose, q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) are used to allow decision-makers to their assessments in a wider space and to better deal with ambiguous information. Accordingly, two different Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approaches are recommended under the q-ROFS environment and applied to determine the most appropriate strategy. The results of the proposed approaches determine the A1 — Mandatory quarantine and strict isolation strategy as the best strategy. Comparisons with other q-rung orthopair fuzzy MCDM methods and intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method are also presented for the validation of the proposed methods. Besides, sensitivity analyses are conducted to check the robustness of the proposed approaches and to observe the effect of the change in the q parameter.}

Our study contributes to the literature by discussing the challenges associated with technological innovation and education of aviation professionals, on the way towards pandemic-resilient aviation. We discuss issues surrounding technologies for smarter aircraft, smarter airports, and smarter airlines. While technology ensures long-term competitiveness and sustainability, an often-ignored source of challenges are human resources and education. COVID-19 has uncovered and magnified the effects of severe concerns with the current aviation education system, which need to be solved by extended skill sets, modern technology, and better career perspectives. Without properly addressing these technological and educational challenges, the aviation industry likely misses an distinct opportunity for restructuring towards pandemic-resilient aviation.}

Christopher Freeman's research in relation to changes in techno-economic paradigm and, specifically, in relation to the information and communication technology (ICT) paradigm, cautioned that assessments of these changes needed to go beyond market dynamics to examine social, cultural and political issues. In this paper several predominant themes in his work are foregrounded – the ambiguity of changes within the ICT paradigm; the role of guiding principles in influencing expectations about societal outcomes; and the importance of political factors in shaping the consequences of technological innovation. These three themes are then deployed in a discussion of recent innovations – two technical (5G mobile networks and artificial intelligence-as-a-service) and one institutional (proposals for changes in the international taxation regime in response to claims that the existing regime is inappropriate in the face of global online service provision). In each instance, the aim is to illustrate how following Freeman by giving attention to the themes operates as an important guide to analysis of adjustments to novel deployments of digital technology. The conclusion emphasizes the value of Freeman's contributions to shaping research agendas that acknowledge the need to humanize technology, to consider alternatives to taken-for-granted principles and practices, and to take into account the role of political power in tandem with concentrated economic power.}

To be able to assess ICT-SC theoretically and empirically based on an integrative ICT competence framework and self-concept research with a broad application field, in the present study, we develop a 25-item scale in the German language (ICT-SC25g) using NS1–S4 = 1541 and in the English language (ICT-SC25e) using NS5 = 483. The ICT-SC25g/e measures general and domain-specific ICT-SC (communicate, process and store, generate content, safe application, solve problems) in the adult population (18–69 years) across contexts (private life, work, education). The results indicate good reliability (internal consistency, test-retest reliability). Confirmatory factor analyses support factorial validity and theory-consistent relations with personality traits (e.g., emotional stability) and technology-related measures (e.g., frequency of ICT use, technophobia) confirm construct validity. The scale shows strict measurement invariance across gender and countries. We discuss the application of the ICT-SC25g/e in disciplines that focus on humans interacting with ICT, namely education, human resources, technology acceptance, and public health.}

abstract = {The cosmic evolution of the Internet of things (IoTs) in par with its realization in all spheres of life undertakings, mandates continuous research pursuits in IoT and its associated components. While the rapid evolution of IoTs has facilitated monumental opportunities for humanity, it has also acted as a catalyst precipitating diverse security issues. Cybercrimes have been on the rise as criminals and hackers continue to take advantage of IoT's security loopholes and vulnerabilities. The enormity of the attacks has not only been damaging to the quality of life, but it poses a disservice and an unquantifiable risk to human safety. Thus, a timely and comprehensive review, analysis and investigation of the security of IoTs is crucial. Through a systematic literature review of over 200 articles, we set out the latest findings and trends to provide new insights into the security of IoTs, taking cognizant of its social, economic, technical and legal implications, which will be beneficial to researchers, manufacturers, individuals, organizations, and governments. Although many studies reviewing the state of IoT exist in the literature, no studies shape the area of its security well. Hence, there is currently no study that provides an in-depth survey of the emerging security concerns of IoT from diverse perspectives and in tandem with the current condition of the global world today. Compared to other related reviews on the security of IoTs, this survey encompasses much more technical angles to the security of IoT. It begins with the review of the concept of IoTs, the assessments of its industrial development trends, revolutionary paradigms and updated security of the IoT. Key challenges in the security of blockchain technology, a recent spike in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic are sensitive areas that have remained untouched by previous review works. Additionally, politics and security of electoral votes, forensic issues in the IoT era and much more are some of the new depths missing in the literature of IoT security. Thus, a huge divide in the total adoption and actualization of IoT in diverse areas of human endeavour. This review formalizes the IoT concept, illuminating deep insights into possible solutions to the heterogeneous nature of IoT's security challenges, emerging issues, gaps, opportunities, foresight, and recommendations.}

Modernizing regulatory activities will facilitate simultaneous global submissions and concurrent collaborative reviews, significantly reducing global licensing timelines and variability in globally registered product details. This article describes advancements made within the pharmaceutical industry from theoretical concepts to utilization of structured content and data in CMC submissions. The term Structured Content and Data Management (SCDM) outlines the end-to-end scientific data lifecycle from capture in source systems, aggregation into a consolidated repository, and transformation into semantically structured blocks with metadata defining relationships between scientific data and business contexts. Automation of regulatory authoring (termed Structured Content Authoring) is feasible because SCDM makes data both human and machine readable. It will offer health authorities access to the digital data beyond the current standard of PDF documents and, for a review process, SCDM would “enrich the effectiveness, efficiency, and consistency of regulatory quality oversight” (Yu et al., 2019). SCDM is a novel solution for content and data management in regulatory submissions and can enable faster access to critical therapies worldwide.}

abstract = {Differential privacy (DP) remains a potent solution to what is arguably the defining issue in machine learning: balancing user privacy with an ever-increasing need for data. Practitioners must respect privacy, especially in sensitive healthcare domains. DP strives towards this aim by adding noise to training data to occlude its origin and nature, and is ideal for multiple Neural Network (NN) types. This includes deep varieties that utilise multiple hidden layers, and shallow ones with single hidden layers such as the Radial Base Function Network (RBFN). The work herein explores DP within this context by devising a model that leverages Gaussian RBF parameters to add privacy during training. Our model’s efficacy is examined against two real and three synthetic datasets, with results showing reasonable trade-offs between accuracy and privacy. With high intra-class variation, we retained 100% accuracy for two synthetic datasets and a drop of only 1.72% for another. If privacy is prioritised with low intra-class variation, we achieved accuracy drops of 8%–23% with an inherited epsilon that never exceeds one, indicating a good privacy guarantee. We also show that timely training is achievable on a high-dimensional dataset consisting of 2M records and 170 features.}

However, it is extremely challenging to gain the required level of public acceptance of UAVs without proving safety and security for human life. Conventional UAVs mostly depend upon the centralized server to perform data processing with complex machine learning algorithms. In fact, all the conventional cyber attacks are applicable on the transmission and storage of data in UAVs. While their impact is extremely serious because UAVs are highly dependent on smart systems that extensively utilize machine learning techniques in order to take decisions in human absence. In this regard, we propose to enhance the performance of UAVs with a decentralized machine learning framework based on blockchain. The proposed framework has the potential to significantly enhance the integrity and storage of data for intelligent decision making among multiple UAVs. We present the use of blockchain to achieve decentralized predictive analytics and present a framework that can successfully apply and share machine learning models in a decentralized manner. We evaluate our system using collaborative intrusion detection as a case-study in order to highlight the feasibility and effectiveness of using blockchain based decentralized machine learning approach in UAVs and other similar applications.}

Rapid technological change means that ESCO needs to be updated in a timely manner. Evidence is presented here of how text-mining techniques can be applied to the analysis of data on emerging skill needs arising from Industry 4.0 to ensure that ESCO provides information which is current. The alignment between ESCO and Industry 4.0 technological trends is analysed. Using text mining techniques, information is extracted on Industry 4.0 technologies from: (i) two versions of ESCO (v1.0 - v1.1.); and (ii) from the 4.0 related scientific literature. These are then compared to identify potential data gaps in ESCO. The findings demonstrate that text mining applied on scientific literature to extract technology trends, can help policy makers to provide more up-to-date labour market intelligence.}

We analyse a sample of 174 manufacturing SMEs operating in Italy. Our results illustrate the distinguishing traits of the knowledge search paths required to implement Industry 4.0 technologies in an SME manufacturing setting. In particular, they indicate that the recognition of digital opportunities in both product design and manufacturing processes require a depth of collaboration in the innovation process to capture firm and industry-specific company needs and to create mutual trust among the parties. Conversely, digital opportunities in the realm of product/service platforms require a breadth of search for SMEs to invest in different information technology layers to support the digitalisation of a product. We also find that all three groups of digital opportunities positively influence the extent of adoption of information and digital technologies (e.g., IoT, big data analytics, simulation). Our findings bring finer-grained evidence on how digital opportunities are linked with the adoption of the different types of Industry 4.0 technologies, reflecting the peculiar traits of manufacturing SMEs. Moreover, they show managers how to set specific collaboration strategies with the ecosystem according to the digital opportunities they are willing to pursue.}

To fill this gap, this study adopts the perspective of inertia and explores how the interaction of digitalization with entrepreneurial orientation, firm assets, and organizational legitimacy influences the performance of incumbents in the financial services industry. Using panel data covering listed banks in China during 2007–2019, we find that while digitalization alone does not improve incumbents' performance, the interaction between digitalization and entrepreneurial orientation can contribute to performance as entrepreneurial orientation strengthens. When firm assets are large, digitalization does not contribute to performance, but it does contribute when firm assets are relatively small. The interaction between digitalization and organizational legitimacy undermines incumbents' performance as organizational legitimacy increases. By bridging the entrepreneurship and legitimacy literature using the perspective of inertia, this study identifies the contingency factors affecting the performance implications of the digitalization of financial services industry incumbents, suggesting that they can achieve benefits from digitalization through reductions in inertia.}

In this paper, we use a qualitative study based on focus group design to understand how manufacturing and supply chain management professionals perceive the potential of digital technologies in support of lean practices. We identify eight digital waste reduction mechanisms that illustrate how digital technologies can support lean practices. These include a cluster of mechanisms that augment operational execution in terms of speed and precision of execution, as well as flexibility in space and time. Furthermore, we identify a second cluster of mechanisms that augment decision-making through visibility, feedback, engagement, and prevention. In terms of managerial implications, our findings provide firms with a structured approach how to identify those digital technologies that can most effectively support their respective process improvement activities.}

We also present design recommendations for developing next-generation MES/MOM as a strong core to make factories smart and responsive. First, we analyze the architectural design challenges of MES/MOM in IIoT through a selective literature review. We then present an exploratory case study in which we implement our homegrown MES/MOM data model design based on ISA 95 in Aalborg University's Smart Production Lab, which is a reconfigurable cyber-physical production system. This was achieved through the use of a custom module for the open-source Odoo ERP platform (mainly version 14). Finally, we enrich our case study with three industrial design demonstrators and combine the findings with a quality function deployment (QFD) method to determine design requirements for next-generation IIoT-connected MES/MOM. The results from our QFD analysis indicate that interoperability is the most important characteristic when designing a responsive smart factory, with the highest relative importance of 31% of the eight characteristics we studied.}

These factors are important to achieve success, but sustainable competitive advantage depends on a company's ability to exploit its current assets, while simultaneously exploring new ways of producing value. The ambidextrous balancing of these two areas requires concerted effort and the capacity to balance paradoxical tensions. Literature has thoroughly covered the aspect of how to overcome the trade-off between exploitation and exploration. However, research has only recently started focusing on the pivotal role that digital technologies may play in this process. Our paper contributes to this nascent literature stream by investigating how STs can operate as antecedents of structural ambidexterity. This study relies on the 3rd CINet Survey (2016–2017) involving over 370 companies worldwide. Leveraging on STs and structural ambidexterity as mediators, we used Structural Equation Modelling to show that manufacturing firms with good business performance are in a favorable position to achieve better innovation performances. Our results shed new light on the current debate around the Industry 4.0 transition, with implications for both academics and practitioners.}

We argue that the ‘Society-in-the-Loop’ (SITL) social contract paradigm, in conjunction with the use of Strategic Responsible Innovation Management (StRIM), can together provide a solution for improving distributive justice in trade. Through collaboration with a locally based trade facilitation company, we describe the innovation-planning phase of a blockchain smart contract solution based on Derek Leben's idea of a ‘Rawlsian Algorithm’ (2017). It is demonstrated how this can be used to strengthen the algorithmic fairness of commercial contract implementation in accordance with existing ISO 20022 standards. Since currently no formal design framework exists for modeling blockchain oriented software (BOS), an agile development approach is adopted which takes account of the substantial difference between traditional software development and smart contracts. This method involves the construction of UML Use Case, Sequence, and Class diagrams, with a view to blockchain specificities. Evaluation and feedback from the company is also considered.}

Subsequently, the existing African governance structures established at a continental level are described to provide an overview of the frameworks informing governance within Africa. Specific challenges that need to be overcome to ensure good governance are then addressed and the current governance levels in Africa are evaluated. An assessment of e-government readiness levels both globally and within Africa is offered through an examination of the United Nations E-Government Survey from 2018. Specific barriers to e-government, both abroad and within Africa, are then analysed along with the associated risks relating to e-government systems. It then investigates how digital divides and lack of internet connectivity within Africa can be addressed by new technologies and commitments from both terrestrial and space actors. The opportunities afforded by rapidly growing satellite constellations being deployed to increase connectivity levels and reduce the costs thereof are then analysed in detail and the various planned constellations are assessed on a technical level. Lastly, the potential for Earth Observation and remote sensing data to assist with e-governance activities across sectors including healthcare, education, agriculture, water and sanitation, and emergency responses is investigated.}

Like many areas of medicine, vascular surgery has been transformed by the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. Public health precautions to minimize disease transmission have led to reduced attendance at hospitals and clinics in elective and emergency settings; fewer face-to-face and hands-on clinical interactions; and increased reliance on telemedicine, virtual attendance, investigations, and digital therapeutics. However, a “silver lining” to the COVID-19 pandemic may be the mainstream acceptance and acceleration of telemedicine, remote monitoring, digital health technology, and three-dimensional technologies, such as three-dimensional printing and virtual reality, by connecting health care providers to patients in a safe, reliable, and timely manner, and supplanting face-to-face surgical simulation and training. This review explores the impact of these changes in the delivery of vascular surgical care.}

abstract = {Sustainable urban development calls for a balanced package of conditions that induce a high quality of life (including safety and security) in cities. We argue that modern cities have to develop knowledge‐ based strategies for smart, safe and sound (3‐S) city development, supported by urban performance assessment (UPA) as a framework for sustainable urban planning. The present study builds on these strategic notions and articulates the message that smart urban policy should look into input resources in relation to output performance. Particular attention will be paid to the constituents and the role of multiple safety indicators in urban performance analysis. Next, an appropriate method from the industrial management literature, namely, super‐efficient data en591elopment analysis (SE‐DEA) will be utilized in order to undertake a comparative performance assessment of safety conditions in 57 world cities, followed by a similar analysis for 14 large European cities. Both world‐wide and Europe‐wide, there appear to be significant differences in safety performance of cities, which means that there is much scope for strategic and effective safety policy in many cities.
Resumen
El desarrollo urbano sostenible exige un conjunto equilibrado de condiciones que puedan crear una alta calidad de vida (incluida la seguridad y la protección) en las ciudades. Se sostiene que las ciudades modernas tienen que desarrollar estrategias basadas en el conocimiento para un desarrollo de las ciudades que sea 3‐S (sabio, seguro y sensato), apoyado por el uso de la evaluación del rendimiento urbano como un marco conceptual para la planificación urbana sostenible. El presente estudio se basa en estas nociones estratégicas y articula el mensaje de que una política urbana inteligente debe examinar los recursos de los insumos en relación con el rendimiento de los productos. Se prestó especial atención a los componentes y al papel de los múltiples indicadores de seguridad en el análisis del desempeño urbano. A continuación, se empleó un método apropiado obtenido de la literatura sobre gestión industrial, a saber, el análisis envolvente de datos supereficiente para realizar una evaluación comparativa de las condiciones de seguridad en 57 ciudades del mundo, seguido de un análisis similar para 14 grandes ciudades europeas. Tanto en todo el mundo como en toda Europa, parece haber diferencias significativas en el desempeño de las ciudades en materia de seguridad, lo que significa que hay un amplio margen en muchas ciudades para la introducción de políticas de seguridad estratégica y eficaz.

abstract = {The rapid digital transformations across every industry sector, accelerated partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, have increased organizations’ use of information systems for operational and strategic purposes. These organizational responses have led to a confluence of digital, biological, and physical technologies that are revolutionizing business practices and workflows. But accompanying the pervasive use of digital technologies and the evolutionary nature of digital assets, is a shifting world of cyberattacks and information security (ISec) cybercrimes. Dynamic cybercrimes make it increasingly difficult for managers and researchers to anticipate the types, magnitude, and severity of future information security (ISec) breaches. Thus, we perform a systematic literature review (SLR) that explores, gathers, and categorizes event studies to examine the influence of favorable and unfavorable ISec events on stock markets. We extend the research conducted by Spanos and Angelis (2016) and provide a comprehensive understanding of the market’s efficiency to process public information released about ISec events, ISec contingency factors, and the influence of ISec events on stock prices and factors other than price. Our systematic search reveals 58 relevant papers that include 80 studies. We find that in 75% of the studies ISec events can significantly affect a company’s stock market performance, and that such effects are primarily exhibited within two days before and after the event day. Further, the magnitude of abnormal returns is higher in studies examining unfavorable ISec events, such as ISec breaches, compared to abnormal returns from favorable events, such as ISec investments and ISec certifications. In the end, our SLR serves as a foundation for ISec and management communities to build upon to keep industry and academia apprised of continually developing trends, new attack vectors and types of data breaches, protective ISec behaviors and programs, and their subsequent influences on stock market values and returns.}

abstract = {In the digital information era, dealing with privacy issues is problematic in related research since online activities have become an inevitable trend. Following the privacy paradox, which occurs when online services are increasingly accepted or used despite raising the level of privacy concerns of individuals, there is no need to alleviate individual privacy concerns regarding online services. Accordingly, this study aims to empirically analyze the effect of online privacy concerns, when interacting with individual innovativeness, on individual online service use behavior. For the empirical analysis, a Heckman two-step analysis is performed using South Korean data from the 2019 Korea Media Panel Survey conducted by the Korea Information Society Development Institute. The results provide evidence in contradiction of the privacy paradox. Specifically, the main findings of this study are as follows. First, use of online services and privacy concerns are not a contradictory phenomenon both in principle and behavior but can act as a negative influence or constraint. Second, individuals with high levels of innovativeness actively use online services owing to differences in their acceptance and use of innovation. Third, as online activities become more common, privacy concerns are likely to affect the level of online service use by interacting with other personality traits. As a result, privacy concerns are more likely to act as an influencing variable that moderates the degree or intensity of an individual's use of an online service rather than an independent variable for the use of an online service. The impact of privacy concerns of individuals on the use of online services identified in this study suggests there is a need for an adequate governing mechanism for privacy protection to realize service provision through e-government.}

Therefore, scholars and practitioners seek to make sense of how this phenomenon can be addressed concerning companies’ maturity level of supply chain smartness and sustainability. This paper proposes a novel hybrid methodology combining the Best-Worst Method (BWM) and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) to assess the level of maturity for supply chain smartness and sustainability by weighting the functions of supply chain management. A twin-QFD technique is used to obtain a conceptual design to determine the relationship between the functions of supply chain smartness tools and sustainability indicators to assess the level of maturity, whereas the BWM is used to determine the weights of the functions of supply chain management. A case study in the automotive manufacturing industry is applied to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. The findings disclose the prominent smart technologies (simulation, big data analytics, cloud computing) and sustainability indicators (costs, lead time, and damage and loss) in integrating Industry 4.0 technologies and sustainable supply chain practices. Findings also suggest a guideline to compare the current and targeted levels of smartness and sustainability maturity. This study provides insights for scholars and practitioners and contributes to the body of knowledge by evaluating companies’ maturity of digital transformation and sustainable practices in the supply chain functions.}

abstract = {An overly favorable narrative has developed around the role played by digital technologies in containing Covid-19, which oversimplifies the complexity of technology adoption. This narrative takes sociomaterial arrangements for granted and conceptualizes technology affordance - the problem-solving capability of a technology - as a standard built-in feature that automatically activates during technology deployment, leading to undiversified and predetermined collective benefits. This paper demonstrates that not everything is as it seems; implementing a technology is a necessary but insufficient condition for triggering its potential problem-solving capability. The potential affordance and effects of a technology are mediated by the sociomaterial arrangements that users assemble to connect their goals to the materiality of technological artifacts and socio-organizational context in which technology deployment takes place. To substantiate this argument and illustrate the mediating role of sociomaterial arrangements, we build on sociomateriality and technology affordance theory, and we present the results of a systematic review of Covid-19 literature in which 2187 documents are examined. The review combines text data mining, co-occurrence pattern recognition, and inductive coding, and it focuses on four digital technologies that public authorities have deployed as virus containment measures: infrared temperature-sensing devices; ICT-based surveillance and contact-tracing systems; bioinformatic tools and applications for laboratory testing; and electronic mass communications media. Reporting on our findings, we add nuances to the academic debate on sociomateriality, technology affordance, and the governance of technology in public health crises. In addition, we provide public authorities with practical recommendations on how to strengthen their approach to digital technology deployment for pandemic control.}

abstract = {The contribution of distributed ledger technology (DLT) (e.g. blockchain) and smart contracts to the digitalisation and digital transformation of the construction sector is nascent but rapidly gaining traction. ‘Systematic reviews’ of DLT and smart contract applications that are specific to the construction sector are missing. This paper performs an extensive systematic review of 153 DLT and smart contract papers specific to the design, construction and operation of built assets. The protocols and processes of a systematic review were adopted to ensure full transparency, accountability, reproducibility, and updateability of the results. Through thematic analysis, we identify eight distinct themes of applications for DLT and smart contracts in construction: information management, payments, procurement, supply chain management, regulations and compliance, construction management and delivery, dispute resolution, and technological systems. Each theme identified was analysed to understand current capabilities, applications, and future developments. A cross-themes discussion revealed that DLT and smart contracts are ‘supplementary’ technologies that are used in combination with other technologies (e.g. BIM, IoT, cloud computing) as part of ‘technological systems’ that need to co-evolve in order to enable the themes' applications identified. Research into DLT and smart contracts in construction is rapidly moving from theoretical insights and frameworks into developing proofs-of-concept studies (27 studies) and testing them in case studies (20 studies). The next stage of research involving wider academic communities and industry-wide engagement is expected to begin uncovering the anticipated benefits of DLT and smart contracts through investments into technological systems and testing in real-world pilot studies. The discussion of the themes identified from technology, policy, process, and society perspectives exposed the need for an extended socio-technical approach to the solution in order to deliver the necessary change and impact from the adoption of DLT and smart contracts at speed and scale. The results of this systematic review provide a noteworthy reference point for academics, practitioners and policy makers interested in the future development of DLT and smart contract applications in construction.}

By leveraging I4.0 technologies, a small and medium enterprise (SME) can increase its organizational agility, adaptability, and resilience to cope with today's competitive environment by becoming a valuable and innovative partner in the power dynamics with its large buyer counterparts. However, SMEs face technology, trust, and big data challenges when they adopt I4.0 technologies. This study provides new solutions for SMEs to overcome these three challenges in implementing I4.0. Specifically, the paper proposes the following: (1) a roadmap for the application of I4.0 technologies to enhance the collaboration capabilities of SMEs; (2) a structure for I4.0 standardization to develop and sustain trust among partners; and (3) an improved data science platform for systematizing big data to extract critical information for collaboration solutions for SMEs. Additionally, the solutions are evaluated based on an application case of a Greek SME, demonstrating their potentials for practical implementation.}

The use of mHealth applications depends on cognitive and social factors of individuals in different nations. This study aimed to identify the factors influencing the use of mHealth applications for both “contact-tracing” and “symptom-monitoring” of COVID-19 among Iranian citizens.
Methods
A cross-sectional study with an online survey was conducted among Iranian citizens. Correlation calculation and multiple linear regression analysis were performed on the studied variables to find the effective factors.
Results
A total of 1031 Iranian citizens over the age of 18 participated in this survey. A large percentage of the participants wanted to use the mHealth app to trace contacts of COVID-19 (74.5%) and the mHealth app to identify and monitor COVID-19 symptoms (74.0%). Gender, age, level of education, attitude towards technology, and fear of COVID-19 were among the factors that influenced the intention to use these two apps. The top reasons for using these apps were: “to keep myself and my family safe”, “to control the spread of the coronavirus in general”, and “to cooperate with healthcare professionals”. The reasons given for not using these two apps were related to the issues of “security and privacy” and “doubt in efficiency and usefulness” of them.
Conclusions
The study showed that many participants in this survey were interested in using the COVID-19 apps. Policies, regulations and procedures are needed to protect the privacy of individuals by ensuring data governance. Further investigation with a larger sample is suggested to generalize these results.}

The algorithm in this paper first constructs a three-dimensional Arnold transformation matrix for data unit value encryption in the end of IoTs, and designs a quantum logic intelligent mapping that effectively diffuses the encrypted data units to reduce the linear correlation of the image data and to improve the security performance of IoT edge data. Furthermore, the algorithm designs an AI access strategy for scrambling sequence nodes and builds a random-access route for the elements of the scrambling sequence which can reduce the calculation cost and improve the operating efficiency of IoT system in the ends and intermediate nodes. Finally, the data shared matrix is used to share the encrypted data to achieve the (k, n) threshold strategy. Experimental results prove that the algorithm has high plaintext and key sensitivity and can effectively resist brute force attacks, statistical analysis and differential attacks. The algorithm in this paper provides an AI solution for data security encryption in the ends and the intermediate nodes of autonomous IoT systems.}

abstract = {For industrial enterprises, the transformation to circular business models can be curbed both by operational tools and the lack of relevant data. Lean thinking has offered great flexibility in production processes and systems by challenging mass production practices, resulting in more “Lean” products with less waste. Lean design and Eco-design, associated with Industry 4.0 technologies, can be an efficient structured and methodological approach in developing products based on the circular economy strategies. Indeed, decisions made during the product design stage can significantly impact the sustainability of products throughout their life cycle. Hence, lean design combined with eco-design and Industry 4.0 represents an innovative model to include sustainability throughout the product life cycle. This paper explores the relationship between lean eco-design and I4.0 strategies for designing eco-efficient products based on a literature review. The proposed framework is based on the synergic use of Lean design, Eco-design, and Industry 4.0. It offers the right formula to deliver better and cleaner products using appropriate processes to support manufacturers in designing products, fulfilling customers' needs and expectations. It provides scholars, designers, and managers with valuable insights into deploying strategies to design sustainable products.}

Blockchain is one of the pioneering transformative 4.0 technologies and is seen as the backbone of digital SCs (DSCs). Several attempts have been made to create explorative designs or models, however, forming a strategic Blockchain vision remains a challenge. This paper specifies those customer needs and design requirements that should be prioritized with a systematic approach for effective Blockchain integration into SCs. The proposed functional methodology provides a practical roadmap for practitioners. It is based on the House of Quality (HoQ) method, with its customer-focused design aspect, utilizing a group decision making (GDM) approach with an incomplete intuitionistic fuzzy relation (IIFR) extension. The GDM approach is employed to overcome the biases of decision making, while IIFRs deal with different or complementary focus centers in qualitative data. The usefulness of this methodology is tested with an application, and the results are validated by experts in the field. The results indicate that a Blockchain-based DSC (BC-DSC) is expected to deliver continuing financial benefit, efficient use of time, and the ability to support. Automation, effective coordination, and conformity are identified as highly critical design requirements. GDM and IIFR are combined for the first time in the literature. The originality of this paper comes from its generation of critical factors geared to obtaining an effective BC-DSC structure and the implementation of HoQ as an efficient tool for design.}

In this review, we discuss opportunities and key-barriers to improve application of digital health technologies in the field of autoimmune diseases. We also describe what could be the fully digital pathway of rCTD patients. Smart technologies can be used to provide real-world evidence about the natural history of rCTDs, to determine real-life drug utilization, advanced efficacy and safety data for rare diseases and highlight significant unmet needs. Yet, digitalization remains one of the most challenging issues faced by rCTD patients, their physicians and healthcare systems. Digital health technologies offer enormous potential to improve autoimmune rCTD care but this potential has so far been largely unrealized due to those significant obstacles. The need for robust assessments of the efficacy, affordability and scalability of AI in the context of digital health is crucial to improve the care of patients with rare autoimmune diseases.}

The ever-growing social network data has gained attention in recent years and can be handy for industrial revolution 4.0. With the integration of social networks with the Internet of Things being noticed in different industries to enhance human involvement and increase their productivity, security in such networks is increasingly alarming. Vulnerabilities can be characterized in the form of privacy invasion, leading to hazardous contents, which can be detrimental to social media actors and in turn impact the processes of the overall Social Network-Integrated Industrial Internet of Things (SN-IIoT) ecosystem. Despite this prevalence, the current platforms do not have any significant level of functionality to capture, process, and reveal unhealthy content among the social media actors. To address those challenges by detecting hazardous contents and create a stable social internet environment within IIoT, a statistical learning-enabled trustworthy analytic tool for human behaviors has been developed in this paper. More specifically, this paper proposes a machine learning (ML)-enabled scheme SPY-BOT, which incorporates a hybrid data extraction algorithm to perform post-filtering that arbitrates the users’ behavior polarity. The scheme creates class labels based on the featured keywords from the decision user and classifies suspicious contacts through the aid of ML. The results suggest the potential of the proposed approach to classify the users’ behavior in SN-IIoT.}

abstract = {This study aims to investigate the underlying factors affecting Indonesian individuals' decision to make online purchases. Primary data were collected through a nationwide survey in 2019 covering all 34 Indonesian provinces. Secondary data regarding Indonesian villages' potential (PODES) are utilized to provide information about the availability of infrastructure at the village level. The standard utility/net gain maximization framework is adopted, and a binary logistic regression model is employed. A total of 8854 useable samples are analyzed. The results suggest that the probability of using e-commerce to make online purchases increases if an individual is male, young, married, highly educated, and an entrepreneur, as well as has access to the Internet, can easily find logistic and financial services, has sufficient digital skills, and has not been exposed to harmful content. These results produce several findings: the relative advantages of e-commerce over traditional commerce and the compatibility of e-commerce with individuals' needs and values can drive its adoption; digital skills and the ubiquitous related infrastructures are an essential requirements to expand e-commerce diffusion; exposure to harmful content is empirically discovered to be a barrier to e-commerce adoption. These findings lead the authors to provide recommendations to promote more inclusive e-commerce adoption and optimize the e-commerce sector's contribution to the national economy.}

abstract = {In recent years, smart cities have grown in popularity, both in research and in practice. The focus of smart city studies and policy initiatives has historically been on technology, particularly how information and communication technology can be leveraged to improve city functions. This focus has begun to shift towards sustainability, with many researchers calling for the development of smart, sustainable cities, which can aid efforts of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The connection between smart cities and climate change, however, is not clear. In this review article, we aim to synthesize the recent literature surrounding smart cities and climate change, and to discuss the benefits (or costs) of smart cities with regard to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. In particular, we focus on five key aspects of urban resilience to climate change: infrastructure, public health and well-being, accessibility and equity, sustainable systems, and governance. The literature reveals a higher level of emphasis on infrastructure resilience to climate change than the other categories. Moreover, the research areas differ in the level of connection between smart city initiatives and climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. For example, within the critical infrastructure research area, studies on smart energy systems focus on climate change mitigation, particularly reducing emissions, while studies on smart water systems emphasize adaptation to future floods and droughts. Going beyond the aforementioned research areas, we discuss the role of big data in smart cities, including the benefits and challenges associated with collecting large amounts of data from smart technology, as well as the techniques needed to analyze such data. Finally, we highlight future directions that we believe the research on smart cities needs to focus on, based on the results from our literature review. These include infrastructure and disaster resilience, public health and social equity, and sustainability.}

Digital technologies are now leading us into the fourth agricultural revolution, where sustainable food production is supported by technologies that collect data useful for farm and supply chain performance improvement, along with task automation and compliance. However, the potential benefits of digital agricultural futures are uncertain and plagued by unrealized expectations of previous innovations. The aims of this paper are to articulate current trends in technology and livestock systems and anticipate future trajectories for Agriculture 4.0 in relation to meeting sustainability and animal welfare outcomes for livestock systems. We use a ‘Futures Triangle’ approach to review the role of technology in livestock systems. The main findings are that previous work envisioning technological livestock futures have favoured pull of the future factors (techno-optimists) or weight of the past (techno-pessimists), rather than a balance of pull, push and weighting factors. Responsible Agriculture 4.0 innovation requires public–private collaboration of innovation system stakeholders, including policy makers, farmers, consumers, as well as technology developers, to enable development of transition pathways from a systems perspective. The use of responsible innovation processes, including anticipation on alternative futures, should also be built into innovation processes to support critical reflection on technological trajectories and related innovation system consequences, both desirable and undesirable.}

The speed of innovative technology evolvement, lack of clarity, and delay in taking appropriate managerial and strategic decisions for adopting IOIS demand further research in this area. The robust advancement in digital technologies stresses a proper decision model for the IOIS adoption process. This paper provides a novel model for selecting the best IOIS alternative by considering the contents, scope, and critical decision-making factors affecting supply chain integration. Twelve decision-making factors affecting IOIS selection were identified and categorized under four significant dimensions: technological, operational, application, and innovative for effective decision-making. Study results reveal that project completion time is the most relevant criterion, followed by digital technology enablers and the financial resources required to select IOIS alternatives.}

However, the integration of novel information technologies with safety-related systems also brings new vulnerabilities and risks that challenge the traditional field of safety analysis. Particularly, cyber security threats are becoming key factors in complex accident scenarios in cyber-physical systems (CPSs), where unintentional errors and design flaws overlap with cyber security vulnerabilities that could lead to harm to humans and assets. This overlap between safety and security analysis is still a loosely defined domain without established theories and methods, leading to complications during the risk analysis of CPSs. In this paper, we first describe how the domain of safety science increasingly overlaps with security analysis. Subsequently, based on this overlapping, we illustrate and complement an integrated method for the identification of harm scenarios in CPSs. This method, coined Uncontrolled Flows of Information and Energy (UFoI-E), offers a distinct theoretical foundation rooted in accident causation models and a framework to design diagrammatic representations of CPSs during the analysis. After summarizing these features of the UFoI-E method, we present our original contribution to the method, which is a new practical toolkit for risk identification composed of an ontology of harm scenarios and a database of checklists built from lessons learned analysis and expert knowledge. Finally, we demonstrate an application of the method in an illustrative case and show representative fields for future work.}

In order to address this issue, we present SecureBallot, a secure open-source e-Voting system that completely decouples the voter identification and voting phases by means of proven cryptographic technologies. The effectiveness of SecureBallot is demonstrated both theoretically, by presenting a formal verification of the whole protocol and assessing the security properties of its software components, and practically, by proposing a case study of university elections that contains all the challenges of a generic voting process.}

In this paper, we examine how urban governance approaches for autonomous vehicles development and deployment in the United States are evolving within multi-scalar regulatory contexts. We conceptualize the various types of engagements by cities through four different roles: city as regulator, mediator, data catalyst, and promoter. These categories are not mutually exclusive, but complementary, and are intended to support the development of appropriate models as cities continue to evaluate options for their urban mobility futures. We present two illustrative examples, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Boston, Massachusetts, to analyze how cities vary in their approaches to the new urban mobility sector. These are two of the leading municipalities in the United States on autonomous vehicle testing and deployment, and their experiences are helpful to elucidating the variety of regulatory contexts, approaches to governance, and potential outcomes.}

This paper performs a holistic analysis of artificial intelligence applications to distribution networks, ranging from operation, monitoring and maintenance to planning. The potential artificial intelligence techniques for power system applications and needed data sources are identified and classified. The following data-driven services for distribution networks are analyzed: topology estimation, observability, fraud detection, predictive maintenance, non-technical losses detection, forecasting, energy management systems, aggregated flexibility services and trading. A review of the artificial intelligence methods implemented in each of these services is conducted. Their interdependencies are mapped, proving that multiple services can be offered as a single clustered service to different stakeholders. Furthermore, the dependencies between the AI techniques with each energy service are identified. In recent years there has been a significant rise of deep learning applications for time series prediction tasks. Another finding is that unsupervised learning methods are mainly being applied to customer segmentation, buildings efficiency clustering and consumption profile grouping for non-technical losses detection. Reinforcement learning is being widely applied to energy management systems design, although more testing in real environments is needed. Distribution network sensorization should be enhanced and increased in order to obtain larger amounts of valuable data, enabling better service outcomes. Finally, the future opportunities and challenges for applying artificial intelligence in distribution grids are discussed.}

The development of the IoT industry has led to the emergence of connected devices and home assistants that create smart living environments. However, the continuously generated data accumulated by these connected devices create security issues and raise user’s privacy concerns. The present study aims to explore the main security issues in smart living environments using data mining techniques. To this end, we applied a three-sentence data mining analysis of 938,258 tweets collected from Twitter under the user-generated data (UGD) framework. First, sentiment analysis was applied using Textblob which was tested with support vector classifier, multinomial naïve bayes, logistic regression, and random forest classifier; as a result, the analyzed tweets were divided into those expressing positive, negative, and neutral sentiment. Next, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was applied to divide the sample into topics related to security issues in smart living environments. Finally, the insights were extracted by applying a textual analysis process in Python validated with the analysis of frequency and weighted percentage variables and calculating the statistical measure known as mutual information (MI) to analyze the identified n-grams (unigrams and bigrams). As a result of the research 10 topics were identified in which we found that the main security issues are malware, cybersecurity attacks, data storing vulnerabilities, the use of testing software in IoT, and possible leaks due to the lack of user experience. We discussed different circumstances and causes that may affect user security and privacy when using IoT devices and emphasized the importance of UGC in the processing of personal data of IoT device users.}

This study aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by identifying descriptions, technologies, barriers, advantages, and disadvantages. Three independent researchers carried out a Systematic Literature Review based on the Protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria pre-established in the Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases, 50 articles were selected for analysis. As a result, it was possible to identify the descriptions of agriculture 4.0, propose a definition, and present a compilation of approaches related to the term. Technologies of agriculture 4.0, responsible for revolutionizing and impacting how commodities are produced, processed, traded, and consumed, were also surveyed. Moreover, the barriers that hinder the development of agriculture 4.0 and that limit its progress are listed. The barriers were classified into five dimensions: technological, economic, political, social, and environmental. These are issues that need to be resolved in different areas to achieve a larger scale in countries looking to implement agriculture 4.0. Finally, this study's findings support actors in the agricultural production chain and pave the way for the successful development of agriculture 4.0.

Nevertheless, there is a clear need to digitalize PI as the demand in both traditional and new drugs is constantly growing. Contract Development Manufacture Organizations (CDMOs) have a special digitalizing challenge. Digitalization of PI, and CDMO precisely, should be tightly related to the main aspects of Good Manufacture Practice (GMP), and, to succeed in PI digitalizing requires constant focus on GMP.

The total energy consumption of buildings and transport accounts for more than 70% in global final energy consumption but renewables only meet less than 20% in the demand of heating, cooling and transport. Therefore, buildings and electric vehicles have great potentials in allowing the optimization and balance of supply and demand with their cross-sector transactive behaviors for full-scale flexibility. This paper provides a systematic overview of the positive roles of buildings and interactive transaction behaviors of electric vehicles in establishing sustainable transactive energy community from energy physical space, data cyber space, and human social space. Low-carbon transactive energy solutions with key technologies and latest advances for net zero energy building with high electric vehicle density is discussed in a hierarchical way. Internet of things as the fundamental architecture enables digitalization and interoperability of transactive energy. Blockchain as the core element enables decentralization and transparency of transactive energy.

Due to the data-driven nature of IoT, the data aggregation process in such systems is significantly challenging. The main goal of data aggregation mechanisms is to achieve high Quality of Services (QoS), including optimal data transmission delay, reliability, and energy consumption. Despite various types of available review papers on this particular topic, we feel that the existing literature does not satisfy the requirements of being up to date and comprehensive. This paper presents a systematic literature review for data aggregation mechanisms on IoT that illustrates the critical challenges in the context design issues. Further, the data aggregation mechanisms are divided into two main categories: client-server-based and mobile agent-based ones. The client-server-based data aggregation mechanisms are also presented in three groups: cluster-based, tree-based, and centralized methods. Finally, we outline possible future research trends in data aggregation on IoT.}

abstract = {Disruptive technologies provides unparalleled opportunities to contribute to the identifications of many aspects in pervasive healthcare, from the adoption of the Internet of Things through to Machine Learning (ML) techniques. As a powerful tool, ML has been widely applied in patient-centric healthcare solutions. To further improve the quality of patient care, Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are commonly adopted in healthcare facilities for analysis. It is a crucial task to apply AI and ML to analyse those EHRs for prediction and diagnostics due to their highly unstructured, unbalanced, incomplete, and high-dimensional nature. Dimensionality reduction is a common data preprocessing technique to cope with high-dimensional EHR data, which aims to reduce the number of features of EHR representation while improving the performance of the subsequent data analysis, e.g. classification. In this work, an efficient filter-based feature selection method, namely Curvature-based Feature Selection (CFS), is presented. The proposed CFS applied the concept of Menger Curvature to rank the weights of all features in the given data set. The performance of the proposed CFS has been evaluated in four well-known EHR data sets, including Cervical Cancer Risk Factors (CCRFDS), Breast Cancer Coimbra (BCCDS), Breast Tissue (BTDS), and Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen (DRDDS). The experimental results show that the proposed CFS achieved state-of-the-art performance on the above data sets against conventional PCA and other most recent approaches. The source code of the proposed approach is publicly available at https://github.com/zhemingzuo/CFS.}
