abstract = {Smart cities are developing at increasing speed. Smart cities rely on the deployment of information and communication technology (ICT) that is digitally transforming our habitats. Digital transformation affects several areas from transportation, energy, government to the environment. But, primarily, it affects citizens. Therefore, the adoption of all areas of the smart city holds great research potential. The purpose of this paper is thus to provide an insight into millennials’ adoption of autonomous vehicles (AV), which are at the forefront of future transport. Millennials are an important focus group for smart city concepts since they are keen to adopt technology and new transport modes. Our research focuses on technology adoption, perception of the benefits, security, safety, mobility-related efficiencies and concerns as the key AV adoption factors. The impact of these factors is empirically tested with structural equation modelling using data from 382 millennials. We confirm the perceived benefits of AV are vital factors for AV adoption whereas the perceived safety of AV significantly reduces the influence of various concerns regarding AV.}

This article describes how the IoT influences the Purchasing and Supply Management (PSM) function. Our findings based on interviews and workshop with more than 200 senior European purchasing managers from large corporations suggest that PSM has opportunities to support the development of IoT solutions within firms which are required to work with dynamic and complex markets. At the same time, the IoT supports the development of a more capable and efficient PSM organisation. As part of this early stage theory building effort, we outline scenarios for the future of the PSM function. This leads us to reflect on how PSM leaders manage IoT-related tensions by means of differentiation and integration tactics.}

abstract = {The on demand availability of resources in Cyber physical system (CPS) has emerged as a viable service providing platform to improve the resource usability and reducing the infrastructure costs. Nevertheless, the development recompenses can only be realized after avoiding security and privacy issues. A secure and reliable CPS can offer improved efficiency, usability and reliability along with autonomy. To secure such systems, in 2018 Challa et al. (2018) proposed a security system to extend an authenticated key agreement between a user and a cloud server via trusted authority; as an application, they also customized their system to work with autonomous smart meter and cloud server. Challa et al. then claimed the security of their proposed scheme through formal, informal and automated validations. However, this paper unveils the weaknesses of their scheme and shows that their scheme cannot facilitate in forming a session key between the user/smart meter and the cloud server. Precisely, in the presence of more than one registered users/smart meters, the latter in their scheme may never receive a response message because of a critical design error. Moreover, their scheme lacks the untraceable anonymity and the lack of request verification on cloud server side may also lead to replay and/or denial of services attack. The article then introduces an improved and secure authentication system free of correctness issues, to facilitate a key agreement between user and cloud server via trusted authority. As an application, the proposed system also works for smart meter and cloud server to reach a key agreement. Based on the hardness assumption of Elliptic Curve Decisional Diffi-Hellman Problem (ECDDHP), the formal Random oracle model proves the security of the proposed scheme. Moreover, the robustness of the scheme is explained through informal analysis. The proposed system while providing all known security features has slightly increased the computation and communication costs as compared with the scheme of Challa et al. The proposed scheme completes a cycle of authentication by exchanging 2080 bits in just 13.4066 ms.}

Industry 4.0 dubbed I4.0 marks the fourth in the Industrial Revolution that focuses heavily on interconnectivity, automation, autonomy, machine learning, and real-time data. By 2020, it is estimated that over 30 billion of the world's devices will be connected in some way—which is 20 billion more devices than today! The consistent capturing and transmitting of data among machines provide manufacturing companies with many growth opportunities. The IIoT is expected to transform how we live, work and play. The number one challenge faced by the Industrial IoT is security and privacy. If we cannot alleviate many of the security and privacy issues that impact the Industrial IoT, we will not be able to achieve its full potential. IoT and the trend toward greater connectivity means more data gathered from more places, in real time, to enable real-time decisions and increase revenue, productivity, and efficiency.}

In this context, this paper is focused on investigating the feasibility of transaction malleability within a typical blockchain application aiming to identify scenarios that may lead to a successful transaction malleability attack. Our objective in doing so is to highlight conditions which cause such attack to facilitate the development of protection mechanisms for them. Specifically, this paper presents a successful simulation of transaction malleability attack within the context of blockchain-based electronic voting. The evaluation has identified the impact of parameters, such as network delay and block generation rate in achieving a successful transaction malleability attack, which highlights future directions of research.}

As a consequence, children become actors in world where they use passwords to authenticate themselves from a very young age. As such, there is a need for guidance to inform educators and parents about how to prepare children for responsible password practice. Very little attention has been paid to determining which password-related principles young children should know, and the age at which this information should be imparted. To address this deficiency, we commenced by deriving an ontology of “best practice” password principles from official sources. These password principles encode essential knowledge for password users of all ages and provide a benchmark that can be used to ground a set of age-appropriate ontologies. We compared this benchmark “good practice” ontology to the advice provided by a wide-ranging snapshot of password-related children’s books and parents’ online resources. We then consulted the research literature to identify the skills required to understand and apply each principle, and removed those that were unsuitable for young children. We then consulted parents of young children to help us to confirm the classification of the ontology’s principles in terms of age appropriateness. Parents also helped us to rephrase each principle to maximise accessibility and understandability for each age group. We conclude with our final set of three age-appropriate password best practice ontologies as a helpful resource for early education professionals and parents.}

By conducting a thorough review, we extend Rom and Rohde's (2007) literature review on integrated information systems (IIS) in management accounting. Furthermore, we utilize a modified version of the framework proposed by Rom and Rohde (2007) to classify and interpret the literature. This allows us to understand the differences between IIS and digitalization in accounting, and to illuminate avenues for future research. The paper concludes with an overview of three main differences in how IIS and digitalization have influenced accounting, and three concurrent avenues for future research on digitalization in accounting: the elusive boundaries of accounting, power relations, and knowledge production for decision making.}

The HD control scheme with random switching memory storage which is described by independent Bernoulli variables, is employed to alleviate the burden of the network. Different from the existing work, a novel memory interconnection Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) is structured by taking full advantage of more information of sampling interval and state, and developing some new terms. Moreover, by utilizing the integral inequality treatment techniques together with stochastic analysis methods, several optimized control algorithms (OCAs) with a larger sampling period (LSP) are established for analyzing the FT synchronization issue of homologous error system with the optimal performance index. Then, the desired controllers can be synthesized by resorting to some matrix inequalities. Finally, the chua’s circuit model is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed strategies.}

Simultaneously, the data and insights that can inform consumer attitudes and behaviors often reside outside of firms' direct control. Consciously incorporating these interdependent factors into firms' decision-making is essential for adaptability and sustainable profitability. Building on the “outside-in” perspective, we propose that firm strategies should be informed through the lens of the marketing ecosystem that considers the interrelated and dynamic megatrends. By leveraging advances in data and technology, firms can sense-make the marketplace by extracting insights from massive amounts of diverse consumer data with modern-day analytics. By mapping out the megatrends with marketing analytics, firms can 1) more accurately predict consumers' changing preferences and formulate appropriate strategies to engage with them; and 2) become more market-adaptable and competitive in the present and the future. To deliver sustainably compelling value to customers, firms should adopt an ecosystem mindset and cooperate with various stakeholders. A broad-thinking, agile, and humble firm culture can enable the development of more robust outside-in capabilities. We elaborate on the megatrends in the interconnected world of the marketing ecosystem, and propose emerging research directions in each area.}

However, as with any technology, IoT has introduced a number of security and privacy challenges. Indeed, IoT devices create, process, transfer and store data, which are often sensitive, and which must be protected from unauthorized access. Similarly, the infrastructure that links with IoT, as well as the IoT devices themselves, is an asset that needs to be protected. The focus of this work is examining authentication in IoT. In particular, in this work we conducted a state-of-the-art review of the access control models that have been proposed, including both traditional access control models and emerging models that have recently been proposed and are tailored for IoT. We identified that the existing models cannot cope with indeterminacy, an inherent characteristic of IoT, which hinders authentication decisions. In this context, we studied the two known components of indeterminacy, i.e., uncertainty and ambiguity, and proposed a new model that handles indeterminacy in authentication in IoT environments.}

Depth interviews with senior executives and managers from a global market leader revealed that to achieve digital service-led growth, a firm and its network need to make three interconnected shifts: (1) from planning to discovery, (2) from scarcity to abundance, and (3) from hierarchy to partnership. Organizational identity, dematerialization, and collaboration play a key role in this transformation.

In addition, the existing PSS evaluation methods often omit decision makers’ bounded rationality and vagueness of judgements. To solve these problems, a novel method is proposed by integrating the merit of Best Worst Method (BWM) in reducing the decision makers’ burden of pairwise comparisons of criteria importance, the strengths of TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of Interactive and Multi-Criteria Decision Making) in dealing with decision makers’ bounded rationality and the flexibility of Rough Set Theory (RST) in handling vagueness without prior information. Finally, a case study of sustainability evaluation for smart air-conditioner PSS is used to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.}

abstract = {As the Architecture, Engineering and Construction sector is embracing the digital age, the processes involved in the design, construction and operation of built assets are more and more influenced by technologies dealing with value-added monitoring of data from sensor networks, management of this data in secure and resilient storage systems underpinned by semantic models, as well as the simulation and optimisation of engineering systems. Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin. A definition of such a concept is then given, described in terms of underpinning research themes, while elaborating on areas for future research.}

For example, a major incident may occur during a period of already high demand. In this section, the reader is encouraged to consider how the Safety Risk Model (SRM) is influenced by large changes in demand. These changes induce secondary effects such as demand for consumables (e.g. Personnel Protective Equipment). They also induce tertiary effects along the supply chain.

From an evolutionary point of view, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is grounded and built on the previous revolution, and because it supports the digital technologies is often called, the Digital Revolution. It can be said that its objective assumed the fusion of technologies that bring the physical world closer to the biological and digital world. In the present paper, starting from a brief presentation of previous Industrial Revolutions, we analyze the challenges and opportunities of technological innovations, of technological progress represented by the artificial intelligence. Although the Fourth Industrial Revolution has the potential to increase the revenue and to raise the living standard of humanity, a great challenge for new information technologies is the preservation of privacy life. Starting from such an aspect, we will try to present not only the benefits of this new revolution but also its possible disadvantages. For example, how the work and private life will be affected. An important attention is given by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to the field of energy, which involves clean and renewable energy. In this context, we will discuss the issues that outline the so-called Energy Revolution, that has begun at the planetary level and which involves a global energy production coming from zero-emission technologies as well as the integration of renewable energy sources into a smart overall network.}

The digital revolution is reshaping the way individuals live and work fundamentally, and the public remains optimistic regarding the opportunities Industry 4.0 may offer for sustainability. The present study contributes to the sustainability literature by systematically identifying the sustainability functions of Industry 4.0. In doing so, the study first reviews the fundamental design principles and technology trends of Industry 4.0 and introduces the architectural design of Industry 4.0. The study further draws on the interpretive structural modelling technique to model the contextual relationships among the Industry 4.0 sustainability functions. Results indicate that sophisticated precedence relationships exist among various sustainability functions of Industry 4.0. ‘Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée àun Classement’ (MICMAC) analysis reveals that economic sustainability functions such as production efficiency and business model innovation tend to be the more immediate outcome of Industry 4.0, which pays the way for development of more remote socioenvironmental sustainability functions of Industry 4.0 such as energy sustainability, harmful emission reduction, and social welfare improvement. This study can serve Industry 4.0 stakeholders – leaders in the public and private sectors, industrialists, and academicians – to better understand the opportunities that the digital revolution may offer for sustainability, and work together more closely to ensure that Industry 4.0 delivers the intended sustainability functions around the world as effectively, equally, and fairly as possible.}

Same old processes despite switching over to Outcome Based Education or EESD or Industry 4.0 are being continued. Disruption is most sought after in engineering education as it offers lot of advantages like leadership, profit and professional standing. Many Institutions offering engineering programs try to implement disruptions but fail because of lack of understanding about disruption and the associated processes, required finances, Human Resources and more importantly the innovation capabilities. Disruption is a process where a product outsmarts others through Innovation either in Technology or in Product or in processes. Disruption is building a new eco-system to meet the customer’s purpose of buying a product, service or a program. Of late people are trying to implement innovations in Engineering Education with no knowledge of Disruption, its properties and processes. In this paper, we try to take an example of Kingsmen Coffee, a company trying to disrupt in the Indian market, analyse what it is offering and how they are trying to disrupt the existing players and what lessons does it offer to Engineering Educators in Disruption. Kingsmen Coffee is a coffee dispensing machine with new technology and the way it is creating win-win situations for all the stake holders involved, is a matter of interest and study for Engineering Educators. Through this study of Disruption, essential pre-requisites for disruption to happen are noted and they are used to extrapolate for realizing disruption in engineering education. Some suggestions regarding implementation of Disruption are given.}

This chapter discusses how most of these issues can be addressed through intelligent use of real-time operating data continuously collected from their production facilities. It advocates the use of a data-driven strategy to optimize operational efficiency and maintenance and enable business personnel to quickly and easily take corrective action when abnormal conditions occur. By taking corrective actions in real time, unnecessary costs can be avoided, bottom line profitability is increased, employee safety is maintained, and responsible environmental stewardship is achieved. The strategy uses real-time data infrastructure software as the integration layer between production process control systems (operational technology), business systems, and advanced offline analytics (information technology).}

The systematic review of the available scientific literature revealed limited but rapidly growing coverage of the phenomenon by scientific studies, which have mainly focused on the role of a few digital technologies (above all, the Internet of Things), studied in isolation. The research has mainly adopted an empirical, case-based methodological approach, mostly investigating the industrial equipment, automotive, and IT industries and focusing on the role of digital technologies for the implementation of intermediate and advanced services. This picture calls for future research endeavours to extend the scope of investigation into digital servitization (regarding the technologies covered and their combinatory effect, the potential benefits, and the application domains) and to develop models and frameworks to support decision-making by practitioners.}

The implementation of Industry 4.0 allows these companies to be better equipped to meet mass customization requirements. In Quebec, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the manufacturing industry don’t typically adhere to this technological trend, which creates a performance gap between them and their competitors. One of the main reasons Quebec struggles to keep up is that its SMEs do not seem to be equipped to make this digital transformation. The purpose of this paper is to identify, within a literature review, the prerequisites necessary to prepare manufacturing SMEs for the digital revolution. This review highlights different authors’ work to identify the most common prerequisites that are known. The results will help guide manufacturing SMEs to better prepare their readiness to implement Industry 4.0 and begin their digital transformation. With the results obtained from the research, combined with the design of experiments and a Monte Carlo simulation, it will be possible to validate the prerequisites. This will be done by implementing them in an aluminum product manufacturing SME in Quebec.}

Frequently, the two are mixed and confused despite being different issues and areas of knowledge. The ethical debate raises two main problems: the first, conceptual, relates to the idea and content of ethics; the second, functional, concerns its relationship with law. Both establish models of social behaviour, but they are different in scope and nature. The juridical analysis is based on a non-formalistic scientific methodology. This means that it is necessary to consider the nature and characteristics of the AI as a preliminary step to the definition of its legal paradigm. In this regard, there are two main issues: the relationship between artificial and human intelligence and the question of the unitary or diverse nature of the AI. From that theoretical and practical basis, the study of the legal system is carried out by examining its foundations, the governance model and the regulatory bases. According to this analysis, throughout the work and in the conclusions, International Law is identified as the principal legal framework for the regulation of AI.}

Issues of security and crime prevention, however, are in many cases neglected. Moreover, when researchers do introduce new smart security technologies, they rarely discuss their implementation or question how new smart city security might affect traditional policing and urban planning processes. This systematic review explores the recent literature concerned with new ‘smart city’ security technologies and aims to investigate to what extent these new interventions correspond with traditional functions of security interventions. Through an extensive literature search we compiled a list of security interventions for smart cities and suggest several changes to the conceptual status quo in the field. Ultimately, we propose three clear categories to categorise security interventions in smart cities: Those interventions that use new sensors but traditional actuators, those that seek to make old systems smart, and those that introduce entirely new functions. These themes are then discussed in detail and the importance of each group of interventions for the overall field of urban security and governance is assessed.}

We invested in a mix of desk research with qualitative methods, including interviews, surveys, or ethnographic explorations, together with participatory workshops for collective vision building and speculative prototyping for policy. Our main findings underline key sociotechnical challenges and opportunities for the development and uptake of Blockchain in specific European industrial and business contexts, taking into account the complexity of policy, economic, social, technical, legal and environmental elements. But, aiming to push the frontiers of what's common practice in advice for policy when looking into early-stage technologies as Blockchain, we also strive to emphasize how our approach can benefit decision-makers through robust methodological and conceptual processes that are simultaneously evidence-based and experimental in their delivery and impact.}

abstract = {This chapter highlights the prevailing value of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) data in fighting crime in general and even terrorism. Temporal DNA data will have many values to learn deeper about the behavior of mass killers and even predicting crime before it takes place. Obtaining an inked fingerprint from a person is much less intrusive, costly, and difficult than drawing a blood sample for DNA typing. However, DNA is much more precise and is becoming the de facto for law enforcement crime tracking and getting to the criminal. We switch and start talking demand and consumption of day-to-day data in smart city. The present magnetic storage cannot satisfy the growing demand of magnetic storage. DNA will come to the help. The main focus of the chapter is how we can use DNA for on-demand data storage as well as long-term storage. DNA storage will play a big role in protecting smart city data. Encryption will add more authorization and authentication while data can survive thousands of years.}

In this respect, anomaly detection methods are needed to ensure an assessment of such systems. In this article, we propose a rule-based method for data integrity assessment, with rules built from the system technical specifications and by domain experts, and formalised by a logic-based framework, resulting in the triggering of situation-specific alerts. A use case is proposed on the Automatic Identification System, a worldwide localisation system for vessels, based on its poor level of security which allows errors, falsifications and spoofing scenarios. The discovery of abnormal reporting cases aims to assist marine traffic surveillance, preserve the human life at sea and mitigate hazardous behaviours against ports, off-shore structures and the environment.}

As a result, we confirmed various value chain changes and directions for the development of the electricity industry. Energy consumers are turning into prosumers and influential stakeholders. In addition, the importance of data has been highlighted and the influence of platforms has been expanded. With the changes come along, various market participants appear, and at the same time businesses that do not adapt to the changes are at risk in terms of their market power. It can be seen that the changes demand efforts to encourage consumer participation into the energy market, rational mechanism of energy data sharing, and setting up of an efficient regulatory system. This study contributes to the understanding of the new changes and the demands resulting from ICT convergence in the electricity sector.}

However, due to distinct features including high altitude, moving platforms, large beam footprint and constrained payload, satellite networks are usually designed with unique protocols and functionalities, which hamper the integration of satellite networks with terrestrial mobile networks. The SATIN face many unprecedented technical challenges to achieve optimum performance, seamless user experience, and integrated security protection. This article makes a comprehensive overview of the latest researches from academia and industry to achieve the integrated 5G system. We first introduce the satellite and mobile technology trends, then present the vision of SATIN and related works in the area. Key enabling technologies from perspectives of the radio interface, networking, and security are discussed in depth. Then related standardization initiatives, especially the latest studies at 3GPP, and major industry research projects on non-terrestrial integrated 5G are reviewed.

Most existing calligraphy robots focus on enabling the robots to learn writing through human participation, such as human–robot interactions and manually designed evaluation functions. However, because of the subjectivity of art aesthetics, these existing methods require a large amount of implementation work from human engineers. In addition, the written results cannot be accurately evaluated. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a robotic calligraphy model that combines a generative adversarial network (GAN) and deep reinforcement learning to enable a calligraphy robot to learn to write Chinese character strokes directly from images captured from Chinese calligraphic textbooks. In our proposed model, to automatically establish an aesthetic evaluation system for Chinese calligraphy, a GAN is first trained to understand and reconstruct stroke images. Then, the discriminator network is independently extracted from the trained GAN and embedded into a variant of the reinforcement learning method, the “actor-critic model”, as a reward function. Thus, a calligraphy robot adopts the improved actor-critic model to learn to write multiple character strokes. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model successfully allows a calligraphy robot to write Chinese character strokes based on input stroke images. The performance of our model, compared with the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning method, shows the efficacy of the combination approach. In addition, the key technology in this work shows promise as a solution for robotic autonomous assembly.}

This paper addresses and investigates this gap by applying a qualitative survey of 137 experts. The survey's results are then treated using quantitative cross-sectional analysis to examine the interrelationships between lifestyle domains. Our findings indicate that technological innovation benefits society by improving communication and productivity in the supply chain. However, it causes unintended consequences such as deepening inequality and increasing the surveillance of the public. In addition, although technology provides more options for environmentally conscious choices and better infrastructure, its affordability is a concern. The paper concludes that social dimensions merit greater consideration in terms of multi-dimensional analysis and policy implications. It proposes future research to consider wellbeing as a key determining factor in deciding whether certain technology should be promoted to add value to the social good.}

This study assumes a value chain perspective to analyze the evolutionary trajectories of manufacturing companies. We developed a Delphi-based scenario analysis involving 76 experts from academia and practice. The results highlight the most common expectations as well as controversial issues in terms of emerging business models, size, barriers to entry, vertical integration, rent distribution, and geographical location of activities. Eight scenarios provide a concise outlook on the range of possible futures. These scenarios are based on four main drivers which stem from the experts’ comments: demand characteristics, transparency of data among value chain participants, maturity of additive manufacturing and advanced robotics, and penetration of smart products. Researchers can derive from our study a series of hypotheses and opportunities for future research on Industry 4.0. Managers and policymakers can leverage the scenarios in long-term strategic planning.}

To improve the cyber-security posture, it is important to develop effective methods for cyber-attack response and cyber-security risk assessment. In this research, we develop a finite-horizon semi-Markov general-sum game between the defender (i.e., plant operator) and the attacker to obtain the time-sensitive attack response strategy and the real-time risk assessment in nuclear power plants. We propose methods for identifying system states of concern to reduce the state space and for determining state transition probabilities by integrating probabilistic risk assessment techniques. After a proper discretization of the developed continuous-time model, we use dynamic programming to derive the time-varying and state-dependent strategy of the defender based on the solution concept of the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. For risk assessment, three risk metrics are considered, and an exact analytical algorithm and a Monte Carlo simulation-based algorithm for obtaining the metrics are developed. Both players’ strategies and the risk metrics are illustrated using a digital feedwater control system used in pressurized water reactors. The results show that the proposed method can support plant operators in timely cyber-attack response and effective risk assessment, reduce the risk, and improve the resilience of nuclear power plants to malicious cyber-attacks.}

The digital transformation strategy helps leaders answer the questions for their business such as the current digitalization level, future vision, and how to get there. To be protected from digital disruption, companies need to develop three core competencies related to awareness, informed decision-making, and rapid implementation.

abstract = {Efficient resource management in a Cloud data center relies on minimizing energy consumption and utilizing physical resource efficiently while maintaining the service-level agreement (SLA) at its highest level. To achieve this goal, dynamically consolidating virtual machines (VMs) is considered a promising method, because it eliminates the hotspots resulting from overloaded hosts and switches the underloaded hosts to sleep mode through the live migration of VMs. However, during the consolidation, each VM migration consumes additional resource, leading to performance degradation and SLA violation. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel adaptive performance-to-power-ratio (PPR)-aware dynamic VM consolidation framework based on both the predicted resource utilization and PPR of the heterogeneous hosts to resolve the trade-off of performance and energy. The proposed framework consists of four stages: (1) host overload detection based on residual available computing capacity; (2) selection of the appropriate VMs for migration from the overloaded hosts based on minimum data transfer; (3) host underload detection based on multi-criteria Z-score approach; (4) allocating the VMs selected for migration from the overloaded and underloaded hosts based on the modified power-aware best-fit decreasing algorithm. To validate the reliability and scalability of the proposed method, we performed experimental evaluation in both real and simulated environments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can reduce the energy consumption effectively and ensure maximal conformity to the quality of service (QoS) requirements across heterogeneous infrastructures, in comparison with the existing competitive approaches.}

Urban mobility options have increased in recent years, assisted by the widespread availability of smart device software apps, geo-positioning technology, and convenient electronic financial transactions. Multi-modal shared mobility consists of public transit systems and shared mobilities that support first/last mile travel, denoting the capability of Mobility as a Service (MaaS), and to stimulate additional non-private car travel demand. This paper reviews the supply and demand sides of implementation of multi-modal shared mobility. It found that an abundance of shared modes of car, bike, and e-scooter that are linked to public transport, can improve transport accessibility to meet specific public preferences, reduce social inequality, and minimise dilemmas from the demand side. This study introduces government policy innovations and other supporting system to improve the implementation of multi-modal shared mobility. Government policies play a key role in supporting shared mobility and technology development. However, governments do not have much information about new products such as shared mobility, which creates difficulties in subsidising multi-modal shared mobility services and potentially leads to policy failures around shared mobility schemes. This study suggests that policy entrepreneurship in collaboration with other partners, policy innovation, and the notions of merit goods and second-best policymaking can enable policy initiatives towards multi-modal shared mobility and provide supporting arguments if policies encounter failures. Implementing multi-modal shared mobility requires a collaborative partnership for a paradigm shift: service providers and government must jointly set a merit-based business model, with the support of organisations to achieve improved infrastructure provision, and smart technology applications. The findings will assist the community, business providers and government policymakers to promote multi-modal shared mobility as a pathway towards more efficient, environmentally sustainable, and socially responsive mobility solutions.}

It is clearly acknowledged that after the announcement of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which was enforced in 2018, the worldwide impact has been evolving on the awareness and specification of the data protection. Therefore, data protection at the present era focusing on the area of fintech services is the research object. The objective of this study is to classify categories and definitions of users' sensitive data. Moreover, it analyses methods of defining sensitive data of the user and their realized activities especially as on-line transactions such as Zhifubao-the biggest “third-party electronic payment service platform”. In the meantime, we evaluate the GDPR, compare to the Data Protection Act (DPA), and discuss whether and to what extent it marked a milestone progress above the current legislation of processing data standards, or whether some obstacles have occurred in law implementation process.}

Yet foresight and monitoring tools are important to anticipate on possible futures so that research funding and policy making efforts can be guided. This paper presents a comprehensive two-tiered approach to 1) identify new and emerging technologies and trends in transport and 2) leverage a transport research database and analysis tool to assess the status of transport research and innovation. The approach is applied to the field of Connected and Automated Transport (CAT). The level of public investment is identified and the geographical distribution of research organizations shown. We argue that this approach can aid policy makers to support the future development of CAT technologies and help researchers to forge collaborations and identify research gaps.}

abstract = {This paper describes the core architectures and algorithms of an autonomous small-scale drilling agent. The agent operates in a laboratory rig, demonstrating drilling scenarios with limited or even no human intervention. The work illustrates its performance through self-coordinating state transition, Rate of Penetration (ROP, drilling speed) optimization capability, formation classification, and drilling incidents management. The agent is an original rule-based system, and its control architecture utilizes finite states automation. The novel ROP optimization strategy employs a gradient search in Weight on Bit (WOB)-rotational speed (RPM, Revolutions per Minute) control parameter space. It generates an increasing ROP trend with time and requires re-iteration at abrupt formation changes. Several drilling incidents are managed using ‘if-then’ logic-based activity decomposition. A key learning outcome from the study is the comprehension of the requirement of standard software architecture and Applications Programming Interfaces (API) for continuous research and development of the agent. Such interfaces enhance interoperability between systems and stimulate innovative thinking among independent developers to produce a better-faster set of algorithms. Laboratory testing and evaluation is an essential part of promoting the adaptation of digital technologies for drilling automation. Such studies are a useful, safe, and cost-effective solution for testing, integrating and improving hardware, software, and data management before expensive full-scale testing and integration.}

abstract = {The term “Agri-Food 4.0” is an analogy to the term "Industry 4.0", coming from the concept “agriculture 4.0”. Since the origins of the industrial revolution, where the steam engines started the concept of Industry 1.0 and later the use of electricity upgraded the concept to Industry 2.0, the use of technologies generated a milestone in the industry revolution by addressing the Industry 3.0 concept. Hence, Industry 4.0, it is about including and integrating the latest developments based on digital technologies as well as the interoperability process across them. This allows enterprises to transmit real-time information in terms behaviour and performance. Therefore, the challenge is to maintain these complex networked structures efficiently linked and organised within the use of such technologies, especially to identify and satisfy supply chain stakeholders dynamic requirements. In this context, the agriculture domain is not an exception although it possesses some specialities depending from the domain. In fact, all agricultural machinery incorporates electronic controls and has entered to the digital age, enhancing their current performance. In addition, electronics, using sensors and drones, support the data collection of several agriculture key aspects, such as weather, geographical spatialization, animals and crops behaviours, as well as the entire farm life cycle. However, the use of the right methods and methodologies for enhancing agriculture supply chains performance is still a challenge, thus the concept of Industry 4.0 has evolved and adapted to agriculture 4.0 in order analyse the behaviours and performance in this specific domain. Thus, the question mark on how agriculture 4.0 support a better supply chain decision-making process, or how can help to save time to farmer to make effective decision based on objective data, remains open. Therefore, in this survey, a review of more than hundred papers on new technologies and the new available supply chains methods are analysed and contrasted to understand the future paths of the Agri-Food domain.}

Industry 4.0 promises strategic advantages for companies in many respects, but there is a lack of instruments and concepts for integrating emerging technologies in an overall enterprise system design. Similarly, the multiple perspectives regarding economic, environmental and social sustainability provide a framework for thinking about a strategy for sustainable enterprise design. Based on the three principles presented in this paper for Sustainable Enterprise Design, this article aims to present an approach to better address sustainability as well as Industry 4.0 in terms of a long-term strategic, enterprise design that is sustainable. As a result, a list of needs, functional requirements as well as possible Industry 4.0 physical solutions is proposed to achieve a long-term sustainable enterprise design. The consequence of the perspective of an enterprise as a system that can be designed provides a rigorous approach that takes advantage of Industry 4.0 technologies and the multiple perspectives and candidate physical solutions that the research community offers.}

abstract = {In the wake of industry 4.0, many industries have started to pivot towards digital, collaborative, and smart manufacturing systems by connecting their machinery as part of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT has the potential to provide visibility and improve manufacturing systems through data collection, analysis, and subsequent actions based on insights generated from large amounts of manufacturing data. Even though comparatively newer equipment come readily equipped with embedded sensors and industrial connectivity necessary to connect to the IoT environment, there are many manufacturers (equipment users) who rely on long standing “legacy systems” that offer no or very limited connectivity. In this context, solutions mostly result in the development of low-cost retrofit or upgrade kits that allow integrating legacy equipment into Industry 4.0 environment and thus enable digital servitization. Servitization is a transformation journey that involves firms developing the capabilities they need to provide technical and data-driven services that supplement traditional product offerings. However, retrofitting solutions of legacy equipment rarely involve Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who may otherwise leverage the opportunity to create and capture unique value by retrofitting and then provisioning data-driven value-added services for the manufacturers. Hence, the primary objective of this paper is to identify and analyze the available literature on retrofitting and upgrading of the legacy equipment for Industry 4.0 integration. In doing so, this study also investigates the potential opportunities and challenges of OEMs in supporting the Industry 4.0 transition of legacy equipment in a servitization context.}

Since its initial German conceptualization in 2011, both the technological landscape and the understanding of the Industry 4.0 have evolved significantly leading to several ambiguities. In parallel, similar concepts often used as synonyms − such as “smart manufacturing”, “digital transformation”, and “fourth industrial revolution” − have increased the sense of confusion around the scope and characteristics of the phenomenon. This study approaches the issue through an analysis of almost 100 definitions of Industry 4.0 and related concepts. The review of academic publications has been complemented by a selection of the most influential non-academic sources, including governmental bodies and consulting companies. Each definition has been broken down into its underlying technological and non-technological definitional elements. This categorization will serve as a basis for future research to approach the phenomenon in its multiple facets.}

Based on an in-depth qualitative study and on interviews with experts, the analysis section summarizes the way in which the AI innovation ecosystem in China is being built, which are the key features of the three spheres of the Triple Helix -governments, industry and academic/research institutions-as well as the dynamic context of the ecosystem through the identification of main aspects related to the flows of skills, knowledge and funding and the interactions among them. Using this approach, the discussion section illustrates the specificities of the AI innovation ecosystem in China, its strengths and its gaps, and which are its prospects. Overall, this revisited ecosystem approach permits the authors to address the complexity of emerging environments of innovation to draw meaningful conclusions which are not possible with mere observation. The results show how a favourable context, the broad adoption rate and the competition for talent and capital among regional-specialized clusters are boosting the advance of AI in China, mainly in the business to customer arena. Finally, the paper highlights the challenges ahead in the current implementation of the ecosystem that will largely determine the potential global leadership of China in this domain.}

It finds that while the roots of this literature can be traced back to the 1970s and 1980s, most of it has been published from 2010 onwards. The following aggregate conclusions are extracted from the literature: renewable energy has many advantages over fossil fuels for international security and peace; however, renewable energy is thought to exacerbate security risks and geopolitical tensions related to critical materials and cybersecurity; former hydrocarbon exporters will likely be the greatest losers from the energy transition. Many of the reviewed publications share some weaknesses: a failure to define “geopolitics”; an unwarranted assumption that very little has been published in the field previously; limited use of established forecasting, scenario-building or foresight methodologies; a lack of recognition of the complexity of the field; a lack of theorisation. Most authors do not distinguish between the geopolitical risks associated with different types of renewable energy, and only a few distinguish clearly between the geopolitics of the transitional phase and the geopolitics of a post-energy transition world. A disproportionately large part of the literature is dedicated to critical materials and cybersecurity, while only a small part concerns the decline of former fossil fuel powers. Among those publications that do discuss the decline of fossil fuels, there is also an over-focus on oil producers and a lack of attention to the countries that rely heavily on coal, for example Australia, China, Germany, Indonesia, Poland and the United States.}

To address these issues, this paper conducted a structural topic modeling analysis of 3963 articles published in Computers & Education between 1976 and 2018 bibliometrically. A structural topic model was used to profile the research hotspots. By further exploring annual topic proportion trends and topic correlations, potential future research directions and inter-topic research areas were identified. The major research concerns of the publications in Computers & Education by prolific countries/regions were shown and compared. Thus, this work provided useful insights and implications, and it could be used as a guide for contributors to Computers & Education.}

Innovation development and diffusion is especially challenging for first-time innovators as they cannot build on experiences from prior innovations. We argue that first-time innovators can increase the diffusion success of their innovations by engaging in pre-innovation platform activities. We use the context of the 3D printing platform Thingiverse to show that a consumer's pre-innovation platform activity increases innovation diffusion success and that frequency, quality and relatedness of a consumer's pre-innovation platform activity promotes this effect. We find support that innovation quality, the use of recombinant innovations, and innovation documentation are three mechanisms through which pre-innovation platform activities translate into higher diffusion success of consumers’ first innovation.}

In this chapter, I talk about the definition, causes, consequences, and possible solutions to information overload. One of the solutions lies in the use of artificial intelligence (AI). But this is a double-edged word because, in some cases, it helps to reduce information overload and, in other cases, it helps to increase the problem. I introduce the use of the mind mapping (MM) technique to help reduce information overload in all cases and specifically in cases where AI has a negative effect on this problem. For readers not privy to the MM technique, I provide some introductory references that can be useful to them. I do also provide a detailed example of the advantages of MM in the visualization of the results of the semantic analysis of a complex text using IBM Watson NLU and MM automation software developed by myself to create MindManager mind maps. This is one of those cases where AI produces a large amount of information that has to be organized in the best possible way. MM is, in my opinion, the most adequate way to organize that kind of information. The MM technique is also a very important tool to achieve data democracy through the empowerment of end users when gathering and analyzing complex information. Mind maps are single compressed files containing information, notes, graphs, and links that simplify the organization and treatment of complex information. Finally, an HTML5 version of the mind map used is made available to all readers so that they can appreciate the look and feel of the MM experience by simply using their Internet browser.}

The performance of these algorithms has been evaluated, both individually and in a hybrid approach, for detecting all the states and current state, and predicting the next state (NS), and the next observation (NO) of a given alert observation sequence. For generating this alert sequence, the Snort signature-based intrusion detection system was utilised, using either bespoke or default rules, to raise alerts while examining the DARPA 2000 MSA dataset. The investigation also sheds further light on alternative approaches for forecasting the possible NS and NO in an MSA campaign, as well as, the impact of window size on the prediction performance for all analysed techniques. The results and discussion emphasise on the appropriateness of various techniques for the prediction of NS and NO. Furthermore, NO prediction accuracy has indicated a performance increase of up to 44.95% in the proposed hybrid approaches.}

The growing reliance on cloud computing means that not only should we focus on evaluating its security challenges but devote greater attention towards how challenges are viewed and communicated. With many cloud computing implementations in use and a growing evolution of the cloud paradigm (including fog, edge and cloudlets), comprehending, correlating and classifying diverse perspectives to security challenges increasingly becomes critical. Current classifications are only suited for limited use; both as effective tools for research and countermeasures design. The taxonomic approach has been used as a modeling technique towards classifying concepts across many domains. This paper surveys multiple perspectives of cloud security challenges and systematically develops corresponding graphical taxonomy based upon meta-synthesis of important cloud security concepts in literature. The contributions and significance of this work are as follows: (1) a holistic view simplifies visualization for the reader by providing illustrative graphics of existing textual perspectives, highlighting entity relationships among cloud entities/players thereby exposing security areas at every layer of the cloud. (2) a holistic taxonomy that facilitates the design of enforcement or corrective countermeasures based upon the source or origin of a security incident.

keywords = {Corruption, Big data, Natural language processing, Machine learning, Healthcare, Bribery, Sustainable development goals},
abstract = {Background
Corruption is a significant challenge to the future of human development, economic progress, and population health in the post millennium. Corruption, in its different forms of bribery, fraud, waste, collusion, and illicit financial flows, not only leads to waste but can also erode trust in government and public systems. Corruption is also complex and globalized with different forms of corruption occurring across different countries and multiple industries. One critical tool to leverage in the fight against corruption is the use of innovative technologies such as machine learning.
Methods
In this study, we deployed an unsupervised machine learning methodology using natural language processing to collect and analyze data from the popular social media platform Twitter with the aims of detecting self-reported experiences with corruption, including in the health sector. We collected data from the Twitter public API for keywords associated with corruption and used the biterm topic model to extract themes from the entire corpus of Tweets in order to detect user-generated messages reporting or discussing experiences with corruption.
Results
We analyzed 22, 180, 425 tweets filtered for corruption-related keywords from January–May 2019. Using a combination of NLP and manual annotation, we detected 2383 tweets from 1556 users that included self-reporting of corruption for two dominant themes: police bribery and healthcare corruption. Overall, we found a small number of users actively reporting experiences with corruption, identified users located in countries that are perceived as having higher levels of corruption by their citizens, and found that the majority of messages included reports of users’ own experiences and/or documentation of corruption.
Conclusion
Though technology is not a “silver bullet” that can entirely address the multifaceted nature of global corruption, this study demonstrates its potential utility as a force for good to enable better detection, characterize forms of corruption in different sectors, and hopefully inform future anti-corruption efforts. Additionally, the UN Sustainable Development Goals, with shared goals of fighting corruption, improving population health, encouraging technology adoption, and fostering multistakeholder partnerships, may serve as a critical governance space to catalyze technology-driven anti-corruption approaches.}

In particular, IoT sensors activate optimal conditions to ensure flawless equipment operation, handle biomaterials and chemicals, and prevent fraudulent drug activities. In drug manufacturing, the potential pitfalls for an asset failure due to several causes such as excessive voltage, mechanical damage, chemical deterioration, lack of maintenance, and unstable environment are identified. Hence, continuous real-time monitoring systems are required in pharmaceutical industries to prevent risks regarding unplanned equipment shutdown. The IoT continuously updates the status information on the equipment components such as pressure gauges, air compressors, heat exchangers, sterilizers, vacuum pumps, and multimedia filters. The data acquired by the sensors can be utilized to prevent critical issues, minimize downtime, plan maintenance and repair, and ensure workplace safety. The acquired information can provide a complete sketch of the equipment utilization. This summary assists in generating an overall report that in turn helps in reducing waste and optimizing performance. The various environmental conditions play a significant role in drug manufacturing and, fortunately, the IoT devices enable easy handling of such conditions. The IoT-based pharmaceutical industry creates transparency in drug production and the maintenance environment. The different IoT sensors such as humidity, light, temperature, CO2 level, and radiation are used to enable continuous monitoring in a real-time environment. The acquired information can be continuously updated, enabling rapid environment overview and appropriate measures can be taken immediately. In the case of any disaster, an alert is given to staff members for timely evacuation. The rapid development of IoT technology connects different smart objects that enable data interoperability for healthcare applications in the pharmaceutical industries. The efficient IoT data-accessing method supports timely data access in a distributed heterogeneous environment. It is anticipated that the data generated per second by every human approximates to 1.7MB and the volume of data doubles every 2 years, thereby it was forecast to reach 40ZB by 2020. This chapter deals with the significant role of IoT the in pharmaceutical industry and the ethical issues and countermeasures of accessing heterogeneous data in healthcare services.}

The products account for about 35% of household expenditure in 2005, declining to 32% in 2015. The upper bound effect on the growth rate of the consumption deflator is somewhat less than −0.6 percentage points in 2015.

abstract = {As the demand for multiple healthcare and medical services has risen, the traditional pharma industry has been greatly disrupted, and supply shortages and insufficiency of medicines have become bottlenecks that have limited its growth. Because the Internet of Things (IoT) has clear benefits in obtaining, processing, and implementing data, its deployment in the pharmaceutical sector can help patients by providing them with reduced cost, but also better quality medicines in the shortest time possible. Warehousing is a critical component of pharmaceutical manufacturing. The shortage of specific medicines can have severe implications, while overstocking leads to a waste of products and greater cost of holding inventories. By monitoring products in the warehouse and making optimal use of operators and transportation facilities, smart warehouses can improve real-time visibility in operations. In smart warehouses, sensors collect data on shipment movements—from the warehouses, to allocation and production planning—and help to analyze them further. Data are further collected by the incorporated environmental sensors in temperature-controlled areas of the facility to track the environmental conditions of the products in real time, resulting in lower product expiry rates and degradation due to adverse temperature and environmental conditions. Optimization of the flow of processing resources is necessary to increase operational productivity in warehouses. The IoT helps to achieve this goal through the use of sensors to carry products, which directly relay consumer location information, stock, and mismatches to the handheld device and/or dashboard of the warehouse manager. The device uses sensor information to simulate a 3D view in real time. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags on material-handling equipment in warehouses can be used to track asset locations and movements. Several logistics companies have also attached RFID tags to shipping crates that transport highly sensitive medical drugs. Using smart labels, a small, single product can also be tracked, allowing companies to monitor the product instead of the shipping container. This makes it possible to track each handshake in the supply chain, from manufacturing to dispensing, resulting in a complete digital footprint. There are multiple IoT technologies that can aid in pharmaceuticals packaging, to ensure product quality. These include bidirectional communication, tracking, and status display mechanisms. Drug inventories’ movement can be tracked at every possible point, helping the supply chain sector to reduce costs. However, to fully draw on the promise of the IoT and reap these opportunities across their value chain, pharmaceutical companies need to first invest in a responsive IoT network with the requisite capacity for handling heavy-duty needs and so take full advantage of the opportunities that the IoT has to offer and profit from these advantages. As safety is essential, companies also need to be ready to invest in security solutions based on IoTs. When it is important to communicate with existing systems, it can also become difficult to work with different vendors and to maintain common terminology and standards. In this chapter, we introduce the IoT technologies that can be used in pharmaceutical manufacturing and supply chains to overcome the existing challenges in the industry. Furthermore, we also present open challenges with regards to the implementation of these technologies and the scope for future work in the field, allowing readers to understand the need to implement IoT solutions, but also realize the difficulties in integrating them with the current architecture.}

In this paper, we review trends within agricultural knowledge and advice networks both internationally and in Australia, to anticipate and prepare for potential transformations in these networks. Through a combined structured and traditional review of relevant literature, we come to three key conclusions regarding the state-of-the-art. First, the connectivity of humans and technologies in agricultural knowledge and advice networks and value chains will likely continue to increase. Second, transparency of agricultural practices and informational interaction between farmers, advisors, agri-businesses, consumers and regulators will drive and be driven by growing connectivity. Finally, there are likely to be challenges balancing the priorities of various agricultural stakeholders as agricultural innovation systems digitalise. These findings have implications for the oversight of international agri-food sectors.}

In respect to its practical world applications, the IoT has the prospect of entirely transforming the pharma industry by facilitating and mechanizing the isolated nursing of patients, the innovation of different types of drugs, their admittance, and much more. The combination of the IoT with the growing digitization of figures in the pharma segment has led to a new direction and opened the floodgates for enormous changes and industrial scale innovations. While striving for ingenious inventions, the software needs to keep pace.

The answer is that IoT sensors and detectors can help in enabling the optimal circumstances for supervising different styles of biomaterials and chemicals, detecting tool flaws, and it can be also used to assist in the prevention of fraudulent drug activities. People who are involved in industries like pharmaceuticals work in a risk-prone industry where they must avoid asset failures at any cost, as making mistakes is unacceptable because quality control has a direct impact on the health of the consumer and there should be no opportunities for errors to be made. There are a variety of problems that may arise in plants during the manufacture of drugs, such as wear and tear of equipment with time, corrosion, excessive voltage, and destruction caused by the chemicals used. Keeping a proper track of all these risks is crucial to meet the desired quality of the drug, hence a number of sensors are used for the assimilation of enormous amounts of data from different departments that help in managing, controlling, and supervising everything that takes place, initiating a sequence response for better efficacy and control, which will eventually reduce the production cost, minimize waste, and allow for better control.}

However, there have being an enormous growth in the field of AI-based application within the financial services industry, especially in behavioural finance. This paper addresses the recent developments in AI applications related to algorithms in financial advisory services. Its performance through a theoretical framework based learning model in the financial context, which are effective in producing reliable portfolios based on investors’ behaviour and known as robo-advising. In recent years, the traditional financial services have been replaced by robo-advisors in wealth management industry due to new generation of clients who have the technical know-how of the digital technologies, prefer to have active and ongoing control over their investments while relying on the information from multiple (mainly on-line) sources. Currently, robo-advisors are recognized as most disruptive trend in asset and wealth management. Thus, a robo-advisor can be defined in an automated investment platform which utilizes​ quantitative algorithms to manage investors’ portfolios along with easily accessible to customers through on-line. This paper provides a longitudinal case study based on robo-advisors and behavioural financial decision-making process by investors, because the notion that those behavioural financial decisions are important for successful execution of a customer’s financial portfolios.}

abstract = {In consideration of the general lack of trust in human professional financial advisors due to conflicts of interest, and given inadequacies in terms of the utility of FinTech alternatives for financial goal recommendations, this study establishes a framework for an ontology-based, multiagent recommender system designed to improve financial capability through the recommendation of financial goals, called FinPathlight. The FinPathlight framework provides an architecture for a personal financial recommender system designed to identify and recommend specific, achievable financial goals appropriate to a wide range of financially situated users. This framework contributes principles of implementation for a novel financial technology (FinTech) application aimed at addressing a pervasive lack of trust surrounding traditional financial advisory services, as well as utility inadequacies within the current landscape for FinTech applications, providing a comprehensive set of practical and explicit financial goal recommendations. Considering the importance of users' adoption of an innovation, this study empirically tests its utility in terms of trust and perceived usefulness. The experimental evaluation results show that an application built using this framework would likely be perceived as trustworthy and useful to users for identification and selection of financial capability enhancing objectives.}

One of the important considerations is that the performance and reliability of safety-grade software system must not be degraded by the cyber security controls. However, the nuclear industry has difficulty in applying and verifying the cyber security controls because of the complicated structure of digital I&C systems and the vast amount of cyber security controls. In this study, in order to solve the problem, a cyber security control V&V process model is developed based on the concept of adaptive focusing testing. In addition, a quantitative method for identifying and prioritizing fault-prone cyber security controls is developed. It was confirmed that the developed model can provide an additional and more objective context for the subjective judgement of experts.}

The next big challenge will be the transformation to (digitized) multicountry networked ecosystems. First, the last chapter gives an overview of the remaining key issues in maritime supply chains, hampering the transition from a linear maritime supply chain thinking toward a network industry. It furthermore provides solutions for handling those problems. Second, following Finger and Jaag 2015, the reshaping of the maritime supply chain is discussed from the industry, policy, and management perspectives. Last, some scenarios of how the industry should evolve from partner collaboration (one-to-one collaboration) to a maritime supply network (many-to-many collaboration) are discussed. From a business perspective, this trend of (maritime) actors banding together platform-enabled ecosystems can leverage their strengths and competitiveness.}

In the meantime, the 4th industrial revolution, characterized by several technologies that allow digitalisation, optimisation, automation, customisation and more communication, is in progress. Thus, the ‘Industry 4.0’ can be an enabler for industrial sustainable development. Maintenance processes, which are fundamental for ensuring sustainable operation of manufacturing systems, can benefit from these technologies, with a consequent improvement of maintenance and manufacturing performance. Therefore, a strong synergy between I4.0 technologies and industrial maintenance processes for promoting sustainable manufacturing occurs. Nevertheless, to date, no study investigates thoroughly the effects of such potential synergy on sustainable manufacturing. The aim of this study is two-fold. First, identifying the relation between maintenance processes and I4.0 technologies; then, analysing the positive effects of their integration on the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainable manufacturing. Finally, a preliminary analysis was also conducted to shed light on the negative effects of this synergy on sustainability.}

abstract = {Digital technologies have the potential to make the transport system more connected, intelligent, efficient, reliable and sustainable. That is, digital technologies could fundamentally transform how people and goods are moved, with significant impacts on transport demand and on the related energy consumption and environmental impacts. This article proposes a scenario analysis for the future of European passenger transport, by evaluating the potential effects of digitalization on mobility demand, energy consumption and CO2 emissions under different assumptions. The analysis illustrates that the penetration of digital technologies can lead to opposite effects with regard to both energy consumption and emissions. Two opposite scenarios are compared, to evaluate the effects of a “responsible” digitalization, in the direction of a sustainable mobility, against a “selfish” digitalization, where the final users maximize their utility. The likelihood of these two possible pathways is related to multiple drivers, including users’ behavior, economic conditions and transport and environmental policies. Results show the variability range of the potential effects on energy consumption and CO2 emissions in Europe by 2030 and 2050, by considering digitalization trends including Mobility as a Service, Shared Mobility and Autonomous Vehicles. The variability of key parameters is evaluated in a dedicated sensitivity analysis, where the effects of electric vehicles, electricity generation mixes and vehicles’ efficiency improvements are assessed. The article concludes that in order to fully exploit the advantages of digitalization, proper policies are needed to support an efficient and effective deployment of available technologies through an optimized and shared use of alternative transport options.}
