abstract = {Big Data has recently emerged as a new digital paradigm, one that companies adopt in order to both transform existing business models and nurture their innovation activities. The peculiarities of Big Data applications span different fields such as customer need identification, risk management and decision-making, data-driven knowledge, product and service design, quality management, and opportunity recognition and creation. However, while these have resulted in the emergence of a rich research domain focusing on the managerial and practical implications typically addressed from the user perspective, there is still a lack of complete understanding of how companies that provide Big Data solutions can create and capture value from them. This paper explores the question of how provider companies create and capture value from Big Data, drawing on a multiple-case study analysis of provider companies that offer solutions and services based on Big Data. The results illustrate a theoretical framework on value creation and capture by relying on Big Data and identify two main innovation service strategies based on Big Data used by provider companies. In addition, this paper provides valuable insights as to how the network of involved stakeholders influences the design and implementation of the innovation service strategy by the provider companies.}

Digital health interventions present an important opportunity to improve health care for people with psychosis or bipolar disorder, but despite their potential, integrating and implementing them into clinical settings has been difficult worldwide. This Review aims to identify factors affecting implementation of digital health interventions for people affected by psychosis or bipolar disorder. We searched seven databases and synthesised data from 26 studies using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Attitudes and beliefs about interventions were crucial factors for both staff and service users, with negative attitudes and scepticism resulting in a lack of motivation to engage with interventions or complete them. The complexity of the interventions was a barrier for people with psychiatric symptoms, low premorbid intelligence quotient, or minimal information technology skills. The accessibility and adaptability of interventions were key facilitators, but insufficient resources, finances, and staff time were barriers to implementation. Interventions need to be user friendly and adaptable to the needs and capabilities of people with psychosis or bipolar disorder, and the staff who support their implementation. Service users and staff should cofacilitate the process of developing and implementing the interventions.}

Patient demand for convenience and access continues to surge as these technologies are used for their personal lives. Coupled with the need to lower our health-care cost structure, distance health technologies are emerging as a care facilitator for our arthroplasty patients. A critical aspect of introducing distance health technologies is the requirement to define the entire episode of care. Once defined, metrics to assess success can be measured, and clinical and technical outcomes can be determined. Distance health technologies are emerging in the management of the arthroplasty episode of care through the preponderance of connectivity coupled with the adoption of mobile technologies, ushering in a new era of improved efficiency, efficacy, satisfaction, and outcomes while providing greater value for our patients.}

With the aim of filling this gap, this paper proposes a novel contribution regarding the emerging concept of Digital Academic Entrepreneurship. Based on a qualitative literature review, an interpretative framework for Digital Academic Entrepreneurship is deductively proposed that is composed of the following components: the rationale for the adoption of digital technologies for academic entrepreneurship (why), the emerging forms of digital academic entrepreneurship (what), the stakeholders involved through the digital technologies to achieve the academic entrepreneurship goal (who), and the processes of academic entrepreneurship supported by digital technologies (how). The discussion section provides a conceptualization of Digital Academic Entrepreneurship. The paper closes with the identification of a research agenda for this promising and under-researched field.}

As the fourth industrial revolution or Industry 4.0 becomes the predominant reality, it will bring new paradigm shifts, which will have an impact on the management of occupational health and safety (OHS). In the midst of this new and accelerating industrial trend, are we giving due consideration to changes in OHS imperatives? Are the OHS consequences of Industry 4.0 being evaluated properly? Do we stand to lose any of the gains made through proactive approaches? Are there rational grounds for major concerns? In this article, we examine these questions in order to raise consciousness with regard to the integration of OHS into Industry4.0. It is clear that if the technologies driving Industry 4.0 develop in silos and manufacturers’ initiatives are isolated and fragmented, the dangers will multiply and the net impact on OHS will be negative. As major changes are implemented, previous gains in preventive management of workplace health and safety will be at risk. If we are to avoid putting technological progress and OHS on a collision course, researchers, field experts and industrialists will have to collaborate on a smooth transition towards Industry 4.0.}

The sudden outburst in smartphone technologies has revolutionised human relations creating new possibilities of encounter and connectivity. This paper examines people's smartphone usage patterns and highlights how this is increasing human vulnerabilities in cities with resultant wider societal implications. Drawing on the theory of vulnerability, Hofstede's cultural dimension theory and carrying out semi-structured interviews in the United Kingdom and Ghana, the paper reveals that the current scale of usage and addiction to smartphones and social media are fostering emerging forms of everyday vulnerabilities. Victimisation, privacy breach, home emergencies and road accidents are prevalent vulnerabilities in both Accra and London. By comparing participants' smartphone usage patterns and their motives for adopting or ignoring certain social media practices, the study illustrates how the concept of attitudinal vulnerability extends our understanding of Hofstede's theory of collectivism and individualism. While the finding from Accra complicates Hofstede's collectivism label as there seems to be a loss of genuine sense of care and people-centeredness among participants it confirms individualism tendencies among the participants in London though some tendencies of ‘virtual collectivism’ were observed. In conclusion, the study emphasises how significant behavioural changes among smartphone users can reduce human-induced vulnerabilities in cities. By so doing, we add weight to the literature that focuses on the importance of developing context-specific cutting-edge ICT policies vis-à-vis building smart, safe and sustainable cities.}

Benign notions such as 'cyber democracy' and the ‘information superhighway’ have all but disappeared. In place of these optimistic hopes and projections there's a growing sense of uncertainty, disillusion and, in some cases, fear. Those driving various components of the IT revolution claim new benefits and highlight examples of successful implementation - email, tablets, health innovations and so on. Yet, despite these obvious successes, it's hard to avoid the fact that many IT practices are powerfully disposed in favour of the interests of corporations, innovators and entrepreneurs. This enquiry takes the form of three separate but interrelated papers and has two main purposes. The first paper seeks to account for the underlying polarity between the promoters of high-tech 'solutions' and those who view the world differently. Drawing on a sample of literature including informed journalism it begins by outlining key assumptions (including that technology is 'not merely stuff” and 'new technologies are ambiguous'). It then outlines aspects of the territory through a critical review several key works. Some general conclusions provide starting points for the second and third articles.}

With more medical devices being connected in industry, the security of medical cyber–physical systems has received much attention. Medical smartphones are one of the widely adopted facilities in the healthcare industry aiming to improve the quality of service for both patients and healthcare personnel. These devices construct an emerging CPS network architecture, called medical smartphone networks (MSNs). Similar to other distributed networks, MSNs also suffer from insider attacks, where the intruders have authorized access to the network resources, resulting in the leakage of patient information. In this work, we focus on the detection of malicious devices in MSNs and design a trust-based intrusion detection approach based on behavioral profiling. A node’s reputation can be judged by identifying the difference in Euclidean distance between two behavioral profiles. In the evaluation, we evaluate our approach in a real MSN environment by collaborating with a practical healthcare center. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can identify malicious MSN nodes faster than other similar approaches.}

Against the backdrop of data breach legislation in the United States and European Union, a comparative analysis is undertaken between these jurisdictions and the Australian scheme to elucidate this argument. Firstly, some context to data breach notification provisions is offered, which are designed to address some of the problems data breaches cause for data privacy and information security. There have been various prominent data breaches affecting Australians over the last few years, which have led to discussion of what can be done to deal with their negative effects. The international context of data breach notification legislation will be discussed, with a focus on the United States and European Union jurisdictions, which have already adopted similar laws. The background to the adoption of the Australia legislation will be examined, including the general context of data privacy and security protection in Australia. The reform itself will be then be considered, along with the extent to which this law is fit for purpose and some outstanding concerns about its application. While data breach notification requirements are likely to be a positive step for data security, further reform is probably necessary to ensure strong cybersecurity. However, such reform should be cognisant of the international trends towards the adoption of data security measures including data breach notification, but lack of alignment in standards, which may be burdensome for entities operating in the transnational data economy.}

Each TC brings its own vision and puts forward trends and issues important and relevant for future research. The analysis is performed on the enterprise-level topics with an interface too other relevant systems (e.g., supply chains). The vision developed might lead to the identification of new scientific control directions such as Industry 4.0 technology-enabled new production strategies that require highly customised supply network control, the creation of resilient enterprise to cope with risks, developments in management decision-support systems for the design, and scheduling and control of resilient and digital manufacturing networks, and collaborative control. Cobots, augmented reality and adaptable workstations are a few examples of how production and logistic systems are changing supporting the operator 4.0. Sustainable manufacturing techniques, such closed-loop supply chains, is another trend in this area. Due to increasing number of elements and systems, complex and heterogeneous enterprise systems need to be considered (e.g., for decision-making). These systems are heterogeneous and build by different stakeholders. To make use of these, an environment is needed that allows the integration of the systems forming a System-of-Systems (SoS). The changing environment requires models which adapt over time. Some of the adaptation is due to learning, other mechanisms include self-organisation by intelligent agents. In general, models and systems need to be modular and support modification and (self-)adaptation. An infrastructure is needed that supports loose coupling and evolving systems of systems. The vision of the overall contribution from the research community in manufacturing and logistics systems, over the next few years is to bring together researchers and practitioners presenting and discussing topics in modern manufacturing modelling, management and control in the emerging field of Industry 4.0-based resilient and innovative production SoS and supply networks.}

In such settings, traditional top-down modes of strategic planning are ill-suited to generate the flexibility and speed of change necessary for firms to maintain environmental fitness over time. Survival requires that significant decision-making powers necessarily be located on the operational periphery of the firm. To understand how the resultant multiplicity of micro-strategizing and decision-making might engender macro-level change(s) to business models, we conduct a cross-sectional case study of two business models at Cisco Systems. After problematizing two broad strands of extant theory, we conjecture that a rival theory – complexity theory – might allow us to better explain how Cisco's business models evolve in practice and we utilize our case study to test this conjecture. We find that the business models studied have the capacity to change themselves spontaneously and autonomously from executive-led decisions in response to external stimuli. We offer a novel theoretical insight by postulating the existence of complex adaptive business models and we advance knowledge in a way that is useful for practitioners by suggesting they perceive themselves as facilitators and orchestrators of business models rather than owners or even controllers of them.}

On the horizon, a new generation of even shorter high frequency 5G wavelengths is being proposed to power the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT promises us convenient and easy lifestyles with a massive 5G interconnected telecommunications network, however, the expansion of broadband with shorter wavelength radiofrequency radiation highlights the concern that health and safety issues remain unknown. Controversy continues with regards to harm from current 2G, 3G and 4G wireless technologies. 5G technologies are far less studied for human or environmental effects. It is argued that the addition of this added high frequency 5G radiation to an already complex mix of lower frequencies, will contribute to a negative public health outcome both from both physical and mental health perspectives. Radiofrequency radiation (RF) is increasingly being recognized as a new form of environmental pollution. Like other common toxic exposures, the effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF EMR) will be problematic if not impossible to sort out epidemiologically as there no longer remains an unexposed control group. This is especially important considering these effects are likely magnified by synergistic toxic exposures and other common health risk behaviors. Effects can also be non-linear. Because this is the first generation to have cradle-to-grave lifespan exposure to this level of man-made microwave (RF EMR) radiofrequencies, it will be years or decades before the true health consequences are known. Precaution in the roll out of this new technology is strongly indicated. This article will review relevant electromagnetic frequencies, exposure standards and current scientific literature on the health implications of 2G, 3G, 4G exposure, including some of the available literature on 5G frequencies. The question of what constitutes a public health issue will be raised, as well as the need for a precautionary approach in advancing new wireless technologies.}

In safety-critical infrastructures such as a nuclear power plant (NPP), a cyber-attack could have serious consequences by initiating dangerous events or rendering important safety systems unavailable. Since a cyber-attack is conducted intentionally, numerous possible cases should be considered for developing a cyber security system, such as the attack paths, methods, and potential target systems. Therefore, prior to developing a risk-informed cyber security strategy, the importance of cyber-attacks and significant critical digital assets (CDAs) should be analyzed. In this work, an importance analysis method for cyber-attacks on an NPP was proposed using the probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) method. To develop an importance analysis framework for cyber-attacks, possible cyber-attacks were identified with failure modes, and a PSA model for cyber-attacks was developed. For case studies, the quantitative evaluations of cyber-attack scenarios were performed using the proposed method. By using quantitative importance of cyber-attacks and identifying significant CDAs that must be defended against cyber-attacks, it is possible to develop an efficient and reliable defense strategy against cyber-attacks on NPPs.}

The intent of dependability process is to ensure that these systems will deliver the expected services to its users. In order to ensure the dependability of large safety-critical systems, the software engineer or security professional needs a thorough knowledge of the process of dependability analysis. In the past several decades, a significant amount of attention has been devoted to the dependability assessment of safety-critical control systems from some perspectives such as reliability, availability, safety, and security. However, for analysis of the critical systems, there is no any universal accepted rigorous dependability analysis process, which helps to choose the metrics, techniques and methodologies for the dependability evaluation of such critical systems. This paper provides a comprehensive detailed literature survey in order to investigate different metrics, threats, means, techniques and methodologies to ensure the dependability of computer-based critical systems. The limitations of these elements are also analyzed with respect to their applicability in SC systems.

abstract = {The oil and gas (O&G) industry is transforming rapidly and digital technologies are a considerable factor in that transformation (Nyquist, 2016, Murray and Neill, 2017). However, the changes coming over the next few years have significant potential for even bigger step changes. Gartner (2016) published an extensive report on the opportunities for digitalization of upstream O&G. The report covered the projected operator impact for drilling and wells, field development, and production and operations. In the report, Exxon Mobil's chief computational scientist is quoted as saying, the “oil patch's digital transformation will be comparable to horizontal drilling's tech revolution” (Endress, 2017) (which, of course, was the game-changing technology that enabled the shale gas revolution, among other major industry achievements). Furthermore, the report states that “…he predicts the digitalization of oilfield equipment and operations will continue for the foreseeable future, due to future competitive advantages and untold economic value” (Endress, 2017). This final chapter highlights a few of the exciting technologies that are in development or are being envisioned for the digital oil field (DOF) of the future.}

The UK government regards smart meters to be enablers of a low-carbon energy grid and has set out ambitious consumer-orientated aims within their programme across England, Scotland, and Wales. Despite considerable amount of research on how consumers will (or not) engage with smart meters, media discourses, where some public debates about smart meters are created and reproduced, have received little attention. This paper presents a content analysis of how smart meters are discussed within 11 years of popular print media coverage. A collection of nine discourses are identified: Four of these – “empowered consumers”, “energy conscious world”, “low-carbon grid”, and “future smart innovation” – depict smart meters as a harbinger of positive social change. Five of these – “hacked and vulnerable grid”, “big brother”, “costly disaster”, “astronomical bills”, and “families in turmoil” – represent smart meters as negative forces on society. The results show that discourses and associated storylines mainly represent continuous struggles over particular socio-technical promises linked to smart meters. Somewhat missing are attempts to open up the smart energy debate to broader issues of democracy and energy justice within the print media coverage.}

abstract = {In the era of electronic and mobile commerce, massive numbers of financial transactions are conducted online on daily basis, which created potential fraudulent opportunities. A common fraudulent activity that involves creating a replica of a trustful website to deceive users and illegally obtain their credentials is website phishing. Website phishing is a serious online fraud, costing banks, online users, governments, and other organisations severe financial damages. One conventional approach to combat phishing is to raise awareness and educate novice users on the different tactics utilised by phishers by conducting periodic training or workshops. However, this approach has been criticised of being not cost effective as phishing tactics are constantly changing besides it may require high operational cost. Another anti-phishing approach is to legislate or amend existing cyber security laws that persecute online fraudsters without minimising its severity. A more promising anti-phishing approach is to prevent phishing attacks using intelligent machine learning (ML) technology. Using this technology, a classification system is integrated in the browser in which it will detect phishing activities and communicate these with the end user. This paper reviews and critically analyses legal, training, educational and intelligent anti-phishing approaches. More importantly, ways to combat phishing by intelligent and conventional are highlighted, besides revealing these approaches differences, similarities and positive and negative aspects from the user and performance prospective. Different stakeholders such as computer security experts, researchers in web security as well as business owners may likely benefit from this review on website phishing.}

Communication in the mining industry is the most critical factor to ensure the safety and security of the underground working environment. A robust IT communication infrastructure in underground mining will enhance safety and provide information in real-time which can result in a quick response to some fatal situation. Communication technologies that are capable of bearing the rough terrain and extreme environment inside a mine and between the surface and underground workstations is a critical factor for the monitoring of various underground mining operations remotely. Internet of Things (IoT) can play a massive role in the mining operations to improve the safety of the workers with enhanced productivity. Wireless communication, which is a part of IoT setup, is already playing a vital role in underground mine communication (UMC). Recently, IoT with its building blocks has been introduced to deploy and automate the operation of ‘self-advancing goaf edge support (SAGES)’ systems in an attempt to explore the possibility of the technology for real-time performance monitoring of support system including the behaviour of overlying roof strata in underground coal mines. The machine helps in supporting the roof of the mines during mining the coal. This paper presents a conceptual framework for implementation of IoT to make this underground support system smarter i.e. Smart-SAGES. The taxonomy of security challenges in UMC IoT combination has been described in detail in order to identify clear security goals. The blockchain based system seems to be a promising technology for the mining industry as it may help in curbing the penetration and disruption of cyber-attacks due to heterogeneous devices and distributed network. Various open issues in UMC have also been outlined. Vulnerabilities like information disclosure and Denial-of-Service attack (DoS attack) were discovered during the threat and risk analysis on the SAGES data logger. The SAGES falls into information generation block of IoT ecosystem. Therefore, it is advisable to incorporate the security by design approach from the initial phase of the development. Thus, the data transmission and storage can be made secure.}

abstract = {Chapter Overview
The ultimate goal of harnessing big data is to improve customer service and achieve enterprise business goals while increasing the reliability, resiliency, and efficiency of operations. Thus, business drivers should dictate data needs and the technology roadmap to achieve ongoing improvements in these areas. A data-driven utility should first identify its fundamental business drivers to understand precisely what intelligence is needed for operations and the enterprise and what specific technology supports the creation of intelligence and value, both for current business challenges and for future business needs and technology functionalities. Intelligence, and automation, relies on a two-way, integrated communication system based on standards; thus a utility must first develop a “strong” grid by establishing an information and communications technology foundation based on an open architecture and standards. This first step requires that information technology and communications groups work together to understand and support the functional requirements such as network response requirements, bandwidth, and latency, of each disparate data path—from sensor to end user—for current and future systems and applications. Then a data-driven utility should develop a “smart” grid, which requires the convergence of information technology and operations technology and their respective staffs—the beginning of an operations- and enterprise-wide cultural shift to holistic utility management that focuses on value creation and eliminates organizational silos. On the technology side, integration of data-producing devices and systems precedes automation. Determining substation automation applications relies on observing the behavior of data over time (daily, seasonally) and diverse conditions (weather patterns). On the organization side, all operations and enterprise groups should cooperate to identify their data needs to create a data requirements matrix. Information and operations technology personnel can then determine the least number of platforms and the most efficient paths to route data from device to end user, taking security into account. Access and authentication rules ensure that only the right person gets the right data at the right time. A key concept in a data-driven utility is that every internal stakeholder who can create value from data should have secure access to that data. Operational data is routed to the control center in real time, while nonoperational data is extracted from intelligent electronic devices, concentrated and sent across the operations firewall to be stored and processed in a data mart for on-demand access by enterprise groups and their applications. Three case studies illustrate the value of a data-driven utility in terms of asset management and safety, the fundamentals of standards and interoperability, and the enterprise value, in dollars, of increased visibility into the transmission and distribution network.}

One of the main challenges with existing intelligent phishing detection approaches is that despite their promising detection rates they do not provide novice users with alerting mechanisms in order to enrich users’ experience and knowledge of deceptive techniques. This paper proposes a new anti-phishing technique that not only detects phishing websites accurately, but also offers to novice users an alerting mechanism with rich rules. The key to success in the proposed anti-phishing technique are the features that have been developed by using a hybrid feature analysis. These provide visual cues in the web browser when phishing attacks occur. The rich rules are derived using a fuzzy rule induction approach and they can be utilized by the novice users to understand the security issues of the phishing problem. To evaluate the proposed technique, several experiments have been conducted using feature selection methods and classification algorithms (Furia, SMO, AdaBoost, Naïve Bayes, C4.5) against distinctive feature sets derived from a real phishing dataset. The results show that there are six features, which are not redundant, and when processed using Furia generate effective phishing detection models. More importantly, detection of these features is the basis of an alerting tool for pinpointing possible phishing attacks.}

From a data science perspective, this paradigm shift allows extracting relevant knowledge from monitored assets through the adoption of intelligent monitoring and data fusion strategies, as well as by the application of machine learning and optimization methods. One of the main goals of data science in this context is to effectively predict abnormal behaviors in industrial machinery, tools and processes so as to anticipate critical events and damage, eventually causing important economical losses and safety issues. In this context, data-driven prognosis is gradually gaining attention in different industrial sectors. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the recent developments in data fusion and machine learning for industrial prognosis, placing an emphasis on the identification of research trends, niches of opportunity and unexplored challenges. To this end, a principled categorization of the utilized feature extraction techniques and machine learning methods will be provided on the basis of its intended purpose: analyze what caused the failure (descriptive), determine when the monitored asset will fail (predictive) or decide what to do so as to minimize its impact on the industry at hand (prescriptive). This threefold analysis, along with a discussion on its hardware and software implications, intends to serve as a stepping stone for future researchers and practitioners to join the community investigating on this vibrant field.}

Sixty percent of all terrorist incidents in 2009 occurred in three countries: Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Only 0.2% occurred within the United States. In 2009, nearly 11,000 terrorist incidents occurred worldwide. In 2015, 70% of all deaths related to world-wide terrorism occurred in four countries: Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Syria. According to Control Risks Group, a private consulting firm that evaluates international business risks, the global community should expect “more of the same.” Car and truck bombings will be the most common method of attack. The firm predicts that the major targets will be the United States and British and Israeli military and diplomatic facilities. Other sites include businesses frequented by foreign visitors such as shopping malls, restaurants, bars, and supermarkets. Infrastructure facilities such as energy companies and transportation (including oil refineries) may continue to be targeted. Still other targets identified by Control Risks’ report are commercial shipping and aviation, schools, and churches, as well as individual Western leaders.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) embedded into various planning, production, and management processes in Industry 4.0 must take the initiative and responsibility for making necessary real-time decisions in many cases. In this paper, we suggest the Pi-Mind technology as a compromise between completely human-expert-driven decision-making and AI-driven decision-making. Pi-Mind enables capturing, cloning and patenting essential parameters of the decision models from a particular human expert making these models transparent, proactive and capable of autonomic and fast decision-making simultaneously in many places. The technology facilitates the human impact (due to ubiquitous presence) in smart manufacturing processes and enables human-AI shared responsibility for the consequences of the decisions made. It also benefits from capturing and utilization of the traditionally human creative cognitive capabilities (sometimes intuitive and emotional), which in many cases outperform the rational decision-making. Pi-Mind technology is a set of models, techniques, and tools built on principles of value-based biased decision-making and creative cognitive computing to augment the axioms of decision rationality in industry.}

abstract = {This paper presents a cross-layer communication protocol for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) enabled surveillance system for sensitive fenced areas, e.g., nuclear/oil site. Initially, the proposed protocol identifies the boundary nodes of the deployed WSN to be used as sentinel nodes, i.e., nodes that are always in active state. The remaining nodes are used as duty-cycled relay nodes during the data communication phase. The boundary nodes identification process and data routing are both performed using an enhanced version of the Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) protocol, which relies on a Non Unit Disk Graph (N-UDG) and referred to as GPSR over Symmetrical Links (GPSR-SL). Both greedy and perimeter modes of GPSR-SL forward data through symmetrical links only. Moreover, we apply the Mutual Witness (MW) fix to the Gabriel Graph (GG) planarization, to enable a correct perimeter routing on a N-UDG. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol achieves higher packet delivery ratio by up to 3.63%, energy efficiency and satisfactory latency when compared to the same protocol based on the original GPSR.}

Ubiquitous information communication technologies (ICTs) in SCs enable people to understand and manage cities more efficiently and sustainably, thus improving their life quality. However, a number of potential pitfalls have been noted in the development of SC. This study aims at identifying potential pitfalls in the development of SCs and filling a knowledge gap in this domain. Based on an extensive literature review, four major pitfalls are categorized as system information insecurity, personal privacy leakage, information islands, and digital divide. Possible causes and adverse effects of these pitfalls are discussed with the aid of three international case reviews. In addition, this study looks into existing assessment schemes of SC performance that are mainly focused on the positive and functional capability, but sparingly evaluate the possible downsides. It is argued that a SC cannot claim to be successful by solely measuring how much it has done or what it aims to achieve. While most studies focus on the benefits of SCs, this research reveals the challenges facing city planners. It contributes to the body of knowledge in this regard and also provides an insight into the subject matter. A framework for conducting further research on mitigating potential SC pitfalls has been laid. It is intended to inform practitioners, researchers and policymakers to develop proactive solutions concerning both technological and non-technological aspects at an early stage of SC developments.}

Widely recognized for its potential to generate undue harm, the South Korean government has initiated a movement determined to block the participation of obscene content sharing between youths under the age of 18. While there may be different avenues to examine this phenomenon from, an approach notably absent from this list is the use of big data and data mining information produced via the dispersion of the Internet and social media. Using social big data, the study found that teenagers sexting in hopes of obtaining a higher volume of attention among friends; file sharing is more frequented than image distribution through sexting; and transactions without “adult pornography” and with “smishing” were the most influential in addressing the risks of sexting in South Korea. While big data and data mining do not make any inferences themselves, the benefits of analyzing social big data lies in its ability to incorporate a much larger volume of data and confirm the thoughts of a diverse range of participants.}

Building Information Modeling (BIM) is an innovative technology that is considered as an opportunity for the AEC industry to move to the digital era and improve the collaboration among stakeholders by applying Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). BIM provides all required tools and automations to achieve end-to-end communication, data exchange and information sharing among collaborators. Accordingly, virtual 3D models, created by the BIM process, delivered as physical assets, monitored in real-time and managed using Building Management Systems (BMS), can adopt the Internet of Things (IoT) designs and services. However, the implementation of IoT in a highly modular environment with various moving parts and inter-dependencies between stakeholders leads to security concerns. Therefore, this paper proposes system design that employs the blockchain technology as a measure to secure and control the framework that involves integrated IoT and BIM technologies. Although this paper considers system design applied in a smart museum, the authors assume that design is generic and applicable in other building categories. For instance, this design can be implemented in the ongoing Alumni Hall renovation project at State University of New York College at Oneonta.}

A set of advanced technologies for digitalisation and a theory-based set of seven value drivers for PSM are identified for the proposed grid to facilitate the design of applications and interventions for digitalising PSM. The grid relates the digital technologies to the PSM value drivers in a matrix-like manner, allowing the structured consideration of the space defined by these two dimensions. The proposed approach to the strategic evolution of digitalisation in PSM is tested and its utility is demonstrated in analyses of practitioner literature and multiple case-study-based perspectives on PSM digitalisation. Two fundamental design principles relating to the use of the grid, or to the filling of its space, are set out, thus the research provides new theoretical perspectives on the design of advanced forms of PSM digitalisation. The proposed grid may be used in application design, communicating current and future states of PSM digitalisation to stakeholders, and specifically in developing a future-oriented strategy with a digitalization element for the PSM function.}

We know that everything around us will be in interaction and they will do everything without any need of human interference. For example, when our dishwasher is full, it will start to wash automatically, or when the run out of the gasoline, our car will drive to the nearest station, or even when a burglar is entered to our house, it will automatically be detected and be announced to the police office. In business life, the processes will be automatical in maximum level and this technology will increase productivity and efficiency. Next to mobile technology, it is thought that these new generation information systems (IS) will take the biggest place in our lives. AR also will be integrated to these systems to augment the information in real world. Humanity will augment its habitat in an innovative way thanks to these AR based IS. This paper surveys the current state-of-the-art AR systems related with aerospace & defense, industry, education, medical and gaming sectors. The connection of AR based IS and innovation is explained with a technological insight. In addition to international use cases HAVELSAN’s use cases are also given that are performed from the aspect of applied open innovation strategy.

In this context, customer relationship proneness may guide relationship quality (RQ) by keeping commercial relations alive. This research proposes and examines a conceptual model using a comprehensive management approach that includes market orientation (MO), knowledge management (KM), and perceived relationship investment (PRI) as perceived by customers, which, when available, enhance RQ in an online context. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the effect of RQ on CRP, making a unique contribution to better understanding the continuity of customer–firm relationships. The proposed conceptual model is tested in two different cultures and economic stages, providing relevant insights on the cross-cultural relationship marketing literature. Survey questionnaires are administered to a sample of Spanish and Mexican banking customers, and structural equation modeling, using partial least squares, is used to analyze the data collected. The results show that, in both countries, CRP is significantly influenced by RQ, while PRI should be considered when improving the quality of customer relationships. However, intangible aspects (such as the level of MO or KM) seem to be relevant in more mature, competitive markets whose customers show a higher level of LTO. In terms of practical applications, banks must recognize that customers give different priorities to different capabilities and resources based on their perceptions of the RQ. Hence, banks should give clear priorities to commercial strategies aimed at improving RQ. Implications of the results are discussed, and future research avenues suggested.}

SMART can therefore be used by city leaders to support decision-making toward truly smart cities. The chapter describes Strand One of SMART: the analysis of documented initiatives filtered through four liveability lenses (societal, environmental, economic, and governance). Initiatives are explored as to whether they deliver direct and indirect impacts in support of actions that aim to deliver liveability, their timescale, and their reach in terms of impact on the local population.

A detailed, country-by-country review of science, technology, and innovation (STI) governance, policies, and institutional settings is attempted with emphasis on research and development as well as technology-related incubation facilities. Although addressing national arrangements aimed at promoting STI capacity building, this chapter deals with the Arab countries within five groups, based on geographic and socioeconomic grounds:•The Levant, including Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria;•The Nile valley, namely Egypt and the Sudan;•North African Arab countries, including Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia;•Countries of the Arabian Peninsula, including members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates as well as Yemen;•Arab countries of East Africa: Comoros, Djibouti, and Somalia. Whenever possible both human and financial resources allocated to STI capacity building are discussed in relation to declared national planning priorities. The expected impact of recent national vision and STI planning documents on the state of affairs of their STI systems are discussed and the results of relatively recent surveys conducted by international organizations covering research and innovation facilities institutions are quoted and analyzed. Conclusions reached as a result of the above are seldom complimentary. Thus, with rare exceptions, STI systems in all the above countries were subjected to frequent and radical changes in governance arrangements, particularly over the past decade or so. Additionally, STI policies were seldom implemented as seriously as they were meant to and many were in any case left at just that level, i.e., as policy documents, and were not supported by adequate implementation strategies, with specific goals, work plans, benchmarks, and clear evaluation modalities. Additionally, in general, regulatory and legislative arrangements in place, and advocated for future implementation, leave a good deal to be desired, particularly in regard of university–industry collaboration and in relation to funding research and technology enterprise schemes. In relation to capitalizing of international collaboration, only four countries may be singled out, namely Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia. In each of these countries, mainly research cooperation appears to have witnessed progress that eluded others. Based on detailed observations made within various parts of this chapter, future STI policies and action plans would do well to focus on attaining concrete benefits for inclusive and sustainable development priorities through emphasis on directives that ensure•More effective STI governance, guided by national priorities and equipped by effective monitoring and evaluation modalities;•Enhanced human capital and financial resource allocations across the board;•Serious consideration of STI demand aspects with accent on creating channels between STI institutions and end users of their output;•Smaller and more dynamic and interacting STI facilities rather than large and often intractable STI foundations;•Balance between commercial success, glamorous institutional arrangements, and fashionable research topics, on the one hand, and down-to-earth approaches that prioritize socioeconomic development;•Improved collaboration and networking arrangements among individual Arab countries, on the one hand, and with selected countries around the world with which they enjoy trade and cultural links, on the other. The latter objective is particularly important in all the Arab countries, none of which might claim to have built the critical mass within the broad range of disciplines needed for tackling their development priorities. Further detailed studies are certainly needed in order to explore the abilities of Arab STI systems for handling the numerous challenges posed by global changes on a variety of frontiers, including the political, technological, as well as the environmental. Conclusions reached thus far would indicate that these abilities were largely ineffective in handling past and current challenges and would most likely fall short of meeting many posed by the future.}

The development of sophisticated technologies to obtain, process, and reproduce images and the extensive use of new digital channels for online sales have simplified both production and distribution of counterfeit products. Based on tagging and DNA analysis, as well as web-based monitoring systems, trace and track technologies allow rights holders to combat counterfeiting through effective control of the entire production and distribution chain. This article considers an innovative method of product monitoring based on latest-generation IT platforms, integrated with portable devices, that can easily and immediately verify product authenticity. The spread of these new technological systems is closely related to the role of a party that is glaringly absent in the battle against counterfeiting: the consumer. Indeed, new technologies are the driving element in a virtuous circle where the consumer becomes an essential instrument in the battle against counterfeiting, along with the other players involved: companies, public institutions, and civil society.}

Some of these challenges are chronic information overload and the distractions imposed by multitasking; identity theft and other forms of cybercrime; and the Digital Divide separating information-poor and information-rich segments of the world's population. The spread of cyber technologies in the Digital Age has transformed neighborhoods, workplaces, educational settings, government institutions, scientific collaboration, health-care delivery, online dating, and more.

The 6 research clusters identified by the clustering algorithm are renamed corporate foresight; past & futures; humanity at the limen; environmental futures; post-normality & complexity, and technological trends, according to their underlying themes, and discussed in depth one by one. Several objective observations on the maps’ structure uncover the main research gaps in the literature. Based on these observations, the article provides 6 recommendations on how to fill these research gaps to improve the discipline’s fragmentation. Based on the visualizations, it can also be observed that the majority of futures studies publications belong to two clusters: past & futures and corporate foresight, and that the sudden increase in the total number of futures studies articles citations after 2004 is attributable to the corresponding increase in the relative percentage of research activity in one cluster: corporate foresight.}

Built on an integrative review of the literature, this study offers insights into the potential of smart cities and connected communities in facilitating waste management efforts. Shortcomings of existing waste management practices are highlighted and a conceptual framework for a centralized waste management system is proposed, where three interconnected elements are discussed: (1) an infrastructure for proper collection of product lifecycle data to facilitate full visibility throughout the entire lifespan of a product, (2) a set of new business models relied on product lifecycle data to prevent waste generation, and (3) an intelligent sensor-based infrastructure for proper upstream waste separation and on-time collection. The proposed framework highlights the value of product lifecycle data in reducing waste and enhancing waste recovery and the need for connecting waste management practices to the whole product life-cycle. An example of the use of tracking and data sharing technologies for investigating the waste management issues has been discussed. Finally, the success factors for implementing the proposed framework and some thoughts on future research directions have been discussed.}

This paper developed a framework for IoT-enabled smart government performance. We applied this framework to conduct case study analyses of digital technology policy, IoT cybersecurity policy, and IoT use in major application domains at the U.S. federal government level. The results show that some agencies were strategic and forward-thinking in funding and partnering with sub-national governments in promoting the IoT use. However, there remains a critical need for national IoT policies to promote systemic IoT use across the application domains.}

In the context globalization and shortages in labors, access to goods, services and skills, the need for SMEs to face the competition becomes a crucial issue. This research attempts to develop a model, based on a literature review and case studies, in order to evaluate digital performance as well as to study the assumption that some parameters of the model, such as Leadership, Culture and organization and Data management for example, have different impacts on the performance of SMEs. A literature review and an 80-hour questionnaire-based methodology and field interviews allowed to evaluate the impact on business performance of the different notions revolving around the topic of digital transformation. The results show that the most significant parameters that tend to augment the digital performance and thus help to foster a digital transformation in SMEs are mainly the management commitment and exemplarity (28%), the acquisition and development of skills (26%), the digital architecture (42%), the automation (42%), the quality of data (42%) and the use of the e-commerce (42%). The purpose of this study is then to target those important elements that have the most effect on the performance of small and medium-sized manufacturing companies, with the aim of guiding efforts and investments both in academia and in the real world.}

It inevitably requires understanding the dynamics of platforms and ecosystems. These challenges are amplified for enabling technologies, which are the central focus of this article. The innovator of an enabling technology has a special business model challenge because the applicability to many downstream verticals forecloses, as a practical matter, ownership of all the relevant complements. Complementary assets (vertical and lateral) in the digital context are no longer just potential value-capture mechanisms (through asset price appreciation or through preventing exposure to monopolistic bottleneck pricing by others); they may well be needed simply for the technology to function. Technological and innovational complementors present both coordination and market design challenges to the innovator that generally lead to market failure in the form of an excess of social over private returns. The low private return leads to socially sub-optimal underinvestment in future R&D that can be addressed to some extent by better strategic decision-making by the innovator and/or by far-sighted policies from government and the judiciary. The default value-capture mechanism for many enabling technologies is the licensing of trade secrets and/or patents. Licensing is shown to be a difficult business model to implement from a value-capture perspective. When injunctions for intellectual property infringement are hard to win, or even to be considered, the incentives for free riding by potential licensees are considerable. Licensing is further complicated if it involves standard essential patents, as both courts and policy makers may fail to understand that development of a standard involves components of both interoperability and technology development. If a technology standard is not treated as the embodiment of significant R&D efforts enabling substantial new downstream economic activity, then rewards are likely to be calibrated too low to support appropriate levels of future innovation.}

The static approach of traditional security based on heuristic and signature does not match the dynamic nature of new generation of threats that are known to be evasive, resilient and complex. Organizations need to gather and share real-time cyber threat information and to transform it to threat intelligence in order to prevent attacks or at least execute timely disaster recovery. Threat Intelligence (TI) means evidence-based knowledge representing threats that can inform decisions. There is a general awareness for the need of threat intelligence while vendors today are rushing to provide a diverse array of threat intelligence products, specifically focusing on Technical Threat Intelligence (TTI). Although threat intelligence is being increasingly adopted, there is little consensus on what it actually is, or how to use it. Without any real understanding of this need, organizations risk investing large amounts of time and money without solving existing security problems. Our paper aims to classify and make distinction among existing threat intelligence types. We focus particularly on the TTI issues, emerging researches, trends and standards. Our paper also explains why there is a reluctance among organizations to share threat intelligence. We provide sharing strategies based on trust and anonymity, so participating organizations can do away with the risks of business leak. We also show in this paper why having a standardized representation of threat information can improve the quality of TTI, thus providing better automated analytics solutions on large volumes of TTI which are often non-uniform and redundant. Finally, we evaluate most popular open source/free threat intelligence tools, and compare their features with those of a new AlliaCERT TI tool.}

abstract = {The paper is the story of building a design research group from scratch. As there has been some recent interest in design research as a team based activity, this article illustrates how we built the Imagination research team and how it continues to develop. This article gives us the chance to reflect on how far we have come in the last decade. Once we were a few dedicated members of staff wanting to bring design research to a small university in the north of the UK. Now we are one of the leading centers of excellence worldwide for design research. This article uses case studies from research projects and Ph.D. research to demonstrate Imagination’s research philosophy—open-ended and anti-disciplinary. We celebrate the plurality of ways design research is carried out. The article highlights how we use design research to address global challenges, and how these have also shaped our teaching and further research. We end by considering the value of design research and how we, as a team, can take Imagination forward into the next decade.}

abstract = {One major problem with cyberbullying research is the lack of data, since researchers are traditionally forced to rely on survey data where victims and perpetrators self-report their impressions. In this paper, an automatic data collection system is presented that continuously collects in-game chat data from one of the most popular online multiplayer games: World of Tanks. The data were collected and combined with other information about the players from available online data services. It presents a scoring scheme to enable identification of cyberbullying based on current research. Classification of the collected data was carried out using simple feature detection with SQL database queries and compared to classification from AI-based sentiment text analysis services that have recently become available and further against manually classified data using a custom-built classification client built for this paper. The simple SQL classification proved to be quite useful at identifying some features of toxic chat such as the use of bad language or racist sentiments, however the classification by the more sophisticated online sentiment analysis services proved to be disappointing. The results were then examined for insights into cyberbullying within this game and it was shown that it should be possible to reduce cyberbullying within the World of Tanks game by a significant factor by simply freezing the player's ability to communicate through the in-game chat function for a short period after the player is killed within a match. It was also shown that very new players are much less likely to engage in cyberbullying, suggesting that it may be a learned behaviour from other players.}

This study explores the impact of Smart home dimensions on highly-educated students, drawn from what is known as the “digital native” population, one of the key components of the smart living concept. As digital natives are already engaged with the adoption of new technologies and sustainable development, we have postulated that they would be keen to use smart technologies in the home that could improve their daily life while preserving the environment. This study tests a scale developed to measure consumer perception of the Smart Home Concept (SHC) and the impact on “Performance Expectancy” and “Habit”. The model was built using some of the constructs of existing technology acceptance models, such as the UTAUT2 and TAM2 models. Based on our findings, digital natives seem ready to adopt the SHC and our results highlight the fact that Smart Home products could be targeted at this specific population.}

This paper reviews what is meant by Industrial IoT (IIoT) and relationships to concepts such as cyber-physical systems and Industry 4.0. The paper develops a definition of IIoT and analyses related partial IoT taxonomies. It develops an analysis framework for IIoT that can be used to enumerate and characterise IIoT devices when studying system architectures and analysing security threats and vulnerabilities. The paper concludes by identifying some gaps in the literature.}

Though, a general lack of understanding of how new technologies could be integrated and shall be implemented is present, limiting the rate of adoption of such changes and the related beneficial impacts. This paper describes the implementation of a smart-factory at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI) aiming at filling the gap in I4.0 related skills development thorough a learning by doing approach, and providing a research platform that could foster collaboration of practitioners and academia on the development and testing of new technologies. The developed factory integrates different production technologies such as additive manufacturing, laser processing and milling, in order to produce a highly customizable item consisting in a TANGRAM game-set, packaged into personalized boxes. The entire factory is coupled with its digital twin, which is fed by an exhaustive monitoring infrastructure composed by vision systems and high precision measurement instruments, allowing to track in real time plant processes. The design has been carried out in order to make the smart factory serving as a mean to face both educational and research challenges at many different levels. As an educational mean, students and professionals have the chance to dive into manufacturing history experiencing both classical automation topics (PLC, MES and SCADA programming, precision axes control and pneumatics), as well as more advanced technologies, typical of the most advanced smart-factories (IoT, vision systems, simulation and digital twin, advanced measuring methods and smart production management systems). From a research point of view, the factory functions as a pilot plant for internal research and applied industrial projects, on the top of which applications, manufacturing methods and technologies are developed, tested and integrated.}

abstract = {Changing governance paradigms has been shaping and reshaping the landscape of citizen-administration relationships, from impartial application of rules and regulations by administration to exercise its authority over citizens (bureaucratic paradigm), through provision of public services by administration to fulfil the needs of citizens (consumerist paradigm), to responsibility-sharing between administration and citizens for policy and service processes (participatory paradigm). The recent trend is the administration empowering citizens to create public value by themselves, through socio-technical systems that bring data, services, technologies and people together to respond to changing societal needs. Such systems are called “platforms” and the trend is called “platform paradigm”. The aim of this article is to offer a conceptual framework for citizen-administration relationships under the platform paradigm. While existing models of citizen-administration relationships mainly focus on specific types of relationships, e.g. citizen trust versus administrative transparency, or citizen satisfaction versus administrative performance, the proposed framework identifies a comprehensive set of relationships that explain how decisions by citizens or administration and the policy environment mutually agreed by them contribute to shaping such relationships and building individual and collective capacity for pursuing sustainable development. The framework comprises 15 types of relationships organized along the four governance paradigms. It is illustrated through the analysis of 11 case studies published in the current issue. Based on this analysis, the article also formulates some insights that are relevant to researchers and policymakers who intend to utilize platform governance for sustainable development.}

In on-demand service environments, customer agility involves dynamic capabilities in sensing and responding to citizens. Using this framework, a case study examined a large city government's 311 on-demand services which had leveraged big data analytics. While we found the localized big data analytics use by some of the 22 departments for enhanced customer agility and on-demand 311 services, city-wide systemic change in on-demand service delivery through big data analytics use was not evident. From the case study we identified key institutional mechanisms for linking customer agility to public value creation through 311 services. We posit how systemic use of big data analytics embedded into critical processes enables the government to co-create public values with citizens through 311 on-demand services, indicating the importance of creating a culture of analytics driven by strong political leadership.}

To this end, this paper presents features that are characteristic for SMEs and identify research gaps needed to be addressed to successfully support manufacturing SMEs in their progress towards Industry 4.0. The results of this study show that only a limited number of the SM and Industry 4.0 roadmaps, maturity models, frameworks and readiness assessments that are available today reflect the specific requirements and challenges of SMEs. The main findings include: (1) the current standard starting “level 1″ (base level) of most maturity models appears to be disconnected from the real digitization and smart manufacturing maturity level of many SMEs. Therefore, we propose a “level 0″ specifically designed to reflect the ‘real - base level’ for SMEs; (2) the transition from this new base level, “level 0″, to the current standard “level 1”, requires significant effort including a mind-set change; (3) maturity models and readiness assessments can be associated with an SM toolkit, and (4) SMEs need to develop their own, unique SM or Industry 4.0 vision and roadmap. This study provides insights that help towards developing a realistic SM (Industry 4.0) maturity model for SMEs that reflects their industrial realities more accurately. With the help of SM maturity models that are more customized to the SME specific requirements, the SMEs’ stakeholders will be able to better define their SM (Industry 4.0) vision, roadmap, and strategic projects. It will ultimately lower the entry barrier and reduce the risk of the transition process towards SM and Industry 4.0 and support the critical change in culture. Summarizing, we identified manufacturing SMEs’ specific requirements, conducted a literature review of current SM maturity models, and discussed how these maturity models reflect the SME specific requirements.}

Since the conventional grid is most commonly dependent to fossil-fuel based generation plants, it caused hazardous outcomes such as carbon emission and pollutions deteriorating the environment. Extensive researches and developments have brought a novel grid type called smart grid that allows integrating renewable energy sources (RESs), achieving distributed generation (DG), remote monitoring, remote control, and associating information and communication technologies (ICT) throughout the power network. The everlasting evolution of utility grid requires sophisticated control and communication infrastructures. The Internet of Energy (IoE) or Energy Internet (EI) that both implies same concept has been proposed as a solution to meet requirements of business and industry players. The IoE is assumed as an evolution of smart grid by integration of internet protocols and computational methods to generation, transmission, distribution and consumption levels of utility grid.

abstract = {In recent years, economists have revived the specter of slow growth and secular stagnation. From the point of view of economic history, what should we make of such doomster prophecies? As economic historians all know, for 97% or so of recorded history, the stationary state well-describes the long-run dynamics of the world economy. Growth was slow, intermittent, and reversible. The Industrial Revolution rang in a period of sustained economic growth. Is that growth sustainable? One way to come to grips with that question is to analyze the brakes on economic growth before the Industrial Revolution and examine how they were released. Once these mechanisms are identified, we can look at the economic history of the past few decades and make an assessment of how likely growth is to continue. The answer I give is simple: there is no technological reason for growth in economic welfare to slow down, although institutions may become in some area a serious concern on the sustainability of growth.}

In the long term, decision making and actions execution may become completely machine-autonomous tasks in smart grids due to the progress of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. However, in the short and medium terms, control and monitoring activities will still require human–computer interaction. Due to the inherent characteristics of the smart grids, all gathered and processed data are heterogeneous by nature, being necessary to create novel ICT-based tools and platforms able to offer a broader multi-dimensional control perspective for the energy industry. In this context, visualization plays a key role in facilitating the challenging tasks of monitoring, analyzing, and responding to the events in the smart grid. In this paper, we explore the scientific- and industry-related literature to present a comprehensible survey on visualization methods for smart grids control and monitoring.}

However, researchers are not well informed about the shift of PIP research trends with time. In particular, there is a lack of understanding of what constructs have been studied in what contexts. As a result, researchers may design their study without sufficient guidance. This problem can lead to unproductive efforts in advancing PIP research. Therefore, it is important and timely to review prior PIP research to enhance our understanding of how it has evolved. We are particularly interested in understanding the chronological changes in contexts and research constructs studied. We use a chronological stage model of PIP research we develop, a set of contextual variables identified from prior literature, and the four-party PIP model suggested by Conger et al. (2013) as theoretical foundations to conduct a chronological literature review of empirical PIP concern studies. We find several PIP research trends during the last two decades, such as the quantity of PIP research has drastically increased; the variety of contexts and research constructs being studied has increased substantially; and many constructs have been studied only once while only a few have been repeatedly studied. We also find that the focus of PIP research has shifted from general/unspecified contexts to specific ones. We discuss the contributions of the study and recommendations for future research directions. We propose a fifth party as an emergent player in the ecosystem of PIP and call for future research that investigates it.}

While many are concerned about defining and developing Machine Ethics, Castell's Second Dictum: “You cannot construct an algorithm that will reliably decide whether or not any algorithm is ethical” reveals that this is a futile exercise. Algorithms are also pivotal to the current mania for Crypto-Algorithmic Blockchain Technology Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), with a ‘Crypto Tribe’ of Millennials relentlessly raising billions in real money thereby, to the extent that I have dubbed Crypto the Millennials’ Rock'n’Roll. The seasoned ICT expert professional however bears in mind that there are as yet no ISO standards for blockchain, and there is far more to creating and delivering a complete quality-assured system than just the blockchain component. Furthermore, the legal status of cryptocurrency, smart contract and distributed ledger technology is not clear or uncontentious – and there is already ICO litigation on foot. Nevertheless, taking my limerick-writing Castell GhostWriteBot’s advice, it is perhaps time for my own asset-linked ICO, to launch my CapChere.com concept designed to reboot Capitalism and achieve ubiquitous universal share and wealth ownership.

The rapid urbanization and increasing population have put a lot of strains on city infrastructures and service deliveries. The current urbanization requires strong strategies and innovative planning to modernize the urban life. Many cities are enhancing quality and performance of urban services by being digitalized, intelligent and smarter. The policymakers and city authorities are exploring solutions to deliver the new services in an efficient, responsive and sustainable manner for a large population. The study explores all the possible services among various city dimensions which can make a city smart. The ideas related to smart services are collected from the peer vetted creative crowdsourcing process performed online in India. A directed qualitative conventional content analysis is used to analyze the collected ideas. The unique ideas are clustered into 19 different service categories. The findings suggest multi-dimensional service classification along with required basic infrastructural development. Further, the Smart City Transformation Framework (SCTF) is proposed to help the policy makers, urban developers, government officials and service providers in terms of understanding and to draw more insights from the suggested smart solutions for development of smart cities. There are four key areas (Planning, Physical infrastructure, ICT infrastructure and Deploying Smart solutions) discussed in the proposed framework to illustrate the city transformation. The proposed SCTF is supported by literature and examples adopted by various smart cities across the world to illustrate its effectiveness. Moreover, a mind map is designed to illustrate the interrelationships among the collected ideas in an attractive and procedural visualization for city transformation process.}

Defined as intentional and repeated harm via technology, cyberbullying has provided youth with another medium to experience bullying victimization. The purpose of this study is to examine both cyber and non-physical bullying victimization using Cohen, Kluegel, and Land's (1981) Lifestyles and Routine Activities Theory. Data were derived from the 2013 school crime supplement of the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) for delineating the pattern of cyber and non-physical bullying victimization. This study indicates that cyber and non-physical bullying victimization have similarities and differences reflecting lifestyle and routine activity factors. Youth who had illicit access to alcohol and drugs, used alcohol or drugs at school, and had an affiliation with gang membership involving violence, were more likely to be exposed to potential offenders for both cyberbullying and non-physical bullying victimization. Moreover, while involvement in the performing arts made youth more vulnerable to victimization, youth who followed school rules and were given teacher care were less likely to be targeted. In closing, the study offers effective preventive measures against both cyber and non-physical youth bullying activities.}

Although the importance of this phenomenon, the scientific knowledge is not sufficient. By analyzing the emerging trends of digitization and servitization in manufacturing we tried firstly to identify the key digital technologies to the servitization by studying different frameworks and the national industry 4.0 policy initiatives in Europe. Secondly to describe and explain if and how they enable this transformation. This paper aims specifically to provide a framework which is able to rationalize and systemize the existing knowledge on the topic by conducting a literature review. This study is considered as the first step of a research program on how these two megatrends are jointly disrupting resources, competences, skills and consequently business models. We show that the knowledge about how digital technologies support servitization in manufacturing is still at an early stage and rather limited so future research should aim at better understanding the links between digital and service transformation. Greater knowledge of the impacts of digital technologies on the servitization process will pave the way for the development of contingency models that can support and guide academics and practitioners alike.}

Extending prior rumor research for this context, we develop and test a refined model using data collected from victims of a large scale (hate) rumor spread incident. Our data analyses present three main findings. First, during the crisis situation, platform characteristics of media synchronicity and richness of expression affected the likelihood of rumor recipients believing the false rumor to be a true message. Second, rumors received from people with closer social ties were more likely to be believed as true. Third, rumor belief during the crisis was associated with greater intensity of informational and behavioral actions. Our findings provide governments with insights to mitigate the spread of hate rumor especially under community disaster situations. Implications for research and policy are discussed. This paper contributes to the IS literature on rumor theory and its implications by explaining how diverse communication technologies are used in a community crisis, thereby opening new avenue for future research to address the negative consequences of using communication media in the complex ICT mediated world. It shows how media characteristics along with social ties affect the “politics of plausibility”.}

The spread of digital technologies, renewable energy, and prosumers requires a swift and well-guided adaptation of the electricity distribution industry to smart grid technologies and related business models. This paper, based on the large technical systems (LTS) conceptual framework, investigates the complex evolution and company and market design adaptation needs. Challenges and opportunities are analyzed through nine multi-stakeholder workshops, held in two EU member states (Germany and Portugal) in 2016–2017, engaging distribution system operators, researchers, academics, and integrated utility companies. The results indicate considerable uncertainty for distribution system operators regarding the value of large-scale smart meter rollouts. Also, a corporate culture with resistance to change is observed, challenging the integration of novel technologies and processes. Traditional regulation is seen as a barrier to smart grid investments, and is associated with job losses and knowledge destruction. Policy-makers can benefit from these insights on the dynamics of DSOs, which can contribute to public policy design and market reform which traditionally has often been mainly concerned about operational efficiency in a steady-state, stable economy.}

abstract = {The commodification of digital identities is an emerging reality in the data-driven economy. Personal data of individuals represent monetary value in the data-driven economy and are often considered a counter performance for “free” digital services or for discounts for online products and services. Furthermore, customer data and profiling algorithms are already considered a business asset and protected through trade secrets. At the same time, individuals do not seem to be fully aware of the monetary value of their personal data and tend to underestimate their economic power within the data-driven economy and to passively succumb to the propertization of their digital identity. An effort that can increase awareness of consumers/users on their own personal information could be making them aware of the monetary value of their personal data. In other words, if individuals are shown the “price” of their personal data, they can acquire higher awareness about their power in the digital market and thus be effectively empowered for the protection of their information privacy. This paper analyzes whether consumers/users should have a right to know the value of their personal data. After analyzing how EU legislation is already developing in the direction of propertization and monetization of personal data, different models for quantifying the value of personal data are investigated. These models are discussed, not to determine the actual prices of personal data, but to show that the monetary value of personal data can be quantified, a conditio-sine-qua-non for the right to know the value of your personal data. Next, active choice models, in which users are offered the option to pay for online services, either with their personal data or with money, are discussed. It is concluded, however, that these models are incompatible with EU data protection law. Finally, practical, moral and cognitive problems of pricing privacy are discussed as an introduction to further research. We conclude that such research is needed to see to which extent these problems can be solved or mitigated. Only then, it can be determined whether the benefits of introducing a right to know the value of your personal data outweigh the problems and hurdles related to it.}
