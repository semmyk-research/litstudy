abstract = {While policies and academic interest in smart cities gain momentum, there remain significant gaps in practice and academic conceptualisations explaining it as a new source of innovation. Moreover, there is a need to synthesise reporting behaviours and tools thereof, supporting communication and transparency for citizens along with their involvement in innovation processes. An Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) country analysis highlights gaps in transparency, reporting and communication of results, and the consequent allocation of resources in smart cities. Thus, this study identifies literature streams embracing the notion of smart cities and reporting. It employs a bibliometric and structured literature review analysis. Accordingly, this study proposes a framework comprising four macro-areas, several micro-elements, and the most appropriate implementation of technologies for sustainability challenges. Notably, it contributes to strengthening the smart city as an unconventional source of innovation, providing policymakers an opportunity to account for the smart city's weaknesses and identify areas for significant improvement efforts to be channelled.}

abstract = {This paper explores the governance mechanisms for value co-creation when product–service systems (PSS) providers move into PSS business ecosystems. The PSS providers in our study applied both internal and external governance mechanisms to regulate value co-creation. Internally, they relied on formal organisational setups and informal coordination between product, service and digital divisions. Externally, they had strong relational governance mechanisms supported by appropriate contractual governance mechanisms. As frontline (field) interactions became an important factor for realising value co-creation, PSS providers also attempted to develop individual-based psychological governance to complement group-based relational governance. Our findings reveal five challenges in managing the governance mechanisms: (1) orchestrating all digital resources and capabilities, especially managing the incompatibility and isolation of different digital tools in product and service divisions; (2) managing all relations in one platform that can embrace customer relationship management (CRM), supplier relationship management (SRM) and form relations with emerging actors such as authorities; (3) designing appropriate contractual governance to measure co-created value from economic, societal and environmental perspectives, and govern data ownership and security; (4) managing the interplay between contractual and relational governance mechanisms during PSS agreement implementation; and (5) developing psychological governance for frontline staff. We direct PSS providers towards essential aspects that require attention when developing governance mechanisms by identifying these challenges. Moreover, identifying such challenges will allow policymakers, practitioners, and scholars to jointly develop standards, policies and guidelines in these increasingly prevalent ecosystem business arrangements.}

Nonetheless, its transformational potential has yet to be fully harnessed because of the challenges that digitalization has posed to Business Process Management (BPM) and the inherent complexity of the healthcare processes. Accordingly, through the ambidextrous BPM theoretical lenses, this paper investigates what are the main opportunities for Blockchain-driven healthcare process innovation and which BPM capabilities may unleash them. Two exploratory case studies were conducted to probe the Blockchain-driven process redesign: a case of exploitative BPM, focusing on drug logistics, and a case of explorative BPM, focusing on integrated home care. Our findings suggest that Blockchain may enable Healthcare innovation opportunities, such as the redesign of the information flow and the development of new forms of collaboration in the health ecosystem. In addition, the most relevant BPM capabilities to pursue such innovations were identified. These results integrate the BPM research stream and enhance the understanding of Blockchain-driven healthcare process innovation.}

Self-powered sensing systems augmented with machine learning (ML) represent a path toward the large-scale deployment of the internet of things (IoT). With autonomous energy-harvesting techniques, intelligent systems can continuously generate data and process them to make informed decisions. The development of self-powered intelligent sensing systems will revolutionize the design and fabrication of sensors and pave the way for intelligent robots, digital health, and sustainable energy. However, challenges remain regarding stable power harvesting, seamless integration of ML, privacy, and ethical implications. In this review, we first present three self-powering principles for sensors and systems, including triboelectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric mechanisms. Then, we discuss the recent progress in applied ML techniques on self-powered sensors followed by a new paradigm of self-powered sensing systems with learning capability and their applications in different sectors. Finally, we share our outlook of potential research needs and challenges presented in ML-enabled self-powered sensing systems and conclude with a road map for future directions.}

Interoperability further enables information and usable data to be properly exchanged and ensures the alignment of different business processes in critical sectors. In addition, is a prerequisite for transparent, domain-agnostic, and sustainable public sector digital services, where Public Administrations (PA) can efficiently interact across borders and domains by using common frameworks, standards, and processes for sharing information and data. The European Interoperability Framework (EIF) enables interoperability with guidelines for digital services. Therefore, the alignment with EIF becomes pivotal for the European Union (EU) countries since different regulations that facilitate and impose the implementation of European policies such as the Single Digital Gateway (SDG) regulation and the Once-Only Principle (OOP) consider the IOP a crucial technical and operational component for government digital services. This article proposes the update of the Greek NIF, with guidelines of EIF, OOP and other technological trends in conjunction with new legal and policy provisions. This proposed assessment methodology can be reused in other countries and can be further adapted for updating the EIF.}

In response to this phenomenon, European Union has enacted the European Timber Regulation (EUTR) that imposes economic operators to exercise due diligence thanks to traceability verifications. These are mainly based on a “paper-based” approach, with implementation issues as a consequence. Italy is a interesting case study, since it is the first importer of wood-energy biomass worldwide, where tons of fuelwood without clear traceability are imported every year, and EUTR enforcement still lags behind. Here, a Living Lab involving stakeholders and key informants, carried out a participatory and open assessment of the impact of digital technologies on EUTR enforcement and traceability in the national wood-energy sector. Results reveals that, even if digitalisation is at the first stage, it is far from being only a technological phenomenon since it is already able to impact on different aspects (social, economic, territorial, institutional) related to the EUTR application. Policymakers are therefore recommended to rely on holistic evaluations and approaches that recognise such a complexity, in order to foster a creation of a viable digital ecosystem in favour of EUTR implementation and traceability in the wood-energy sector.}

The aim of the article is to present the author’s concept of steel market enterprises’ maturity for functioning in Industry 4.0. The model is based on the assessment of key technologies or pillars of the new industrial concept. The proposed assessment includes five levels of investment maturity under the conditions of the fourth industrial revolution (a five-point assessment scale was used to measure the degree of maturity of developed enterprises by implemented projects of smart manufacturing (SM). The maturity assessment proposal is based on direct research. The research was carried out in the segment of enterprises from the Polish steel sector. The tool used for the research was a questionnaire survey. The research was carried out with 79 selected steel enterprises in Poland for the pilot study. On the basis of the research, it was established that the segment of enterprises in the Polish steel market are at the third level of maturity in the five-level scale of the model, where level 1 is the “preliminary” level, and 5 represents the optimal maturity level. Within particular pillars of Industry 4.0, according to all respondents, the biggest changes in terms of implementing the industrial concept took place in connection with the use of Internet and mobile technologies in the process of customer service, including EDI, an e-invoicing system. The second position belonged to investments in production automation with the use of individual machines (installation of sensors on devices and sensors for collecting data on the state of the machine). In addition, similar and relatively higher answers were given by respondents to questions about the development and compatibility of IT systems for production support, such as CAx, MRP, MES. The remaining technological pillars, such as data processing from machines, installations of real-time data; network and chain integration (end -to -end engineering); production automation with the use of interoperating machines (production nests); expansion of databases (Big Data) and visualisation of processes together with their optimisation using IoT were found to be initiated as activities in very large and large enterprises. The lowest rated scope of investment changes concerned the block chain in the steel sector. The research of investment of enterprises can be used to assess the maturity of enterprises in this segment of industry in Poland.}

The research methodology was defined based on the PRISMA guidelines, and a reference framework was created that leveraged a thematic analysis of the following content categories: definitions, focus on the food and beverage industry, characterization of cybersecurity, and management of cybersecurity risks. This analysis allowed us to compare the advancement in cybersecurity in the food and beverage industry with those proposed in the literature for the Industry 4.0 paradigm. This comparison is useful, since although the Industry 4.0 paradigm finds a wide range of applications in such domain (e.g., Agriculture 4.0), the structural characteristics of this sector, its supply chain and products create a specific context and situations that may require ad hoc cybersecurity strategies and solutions. The body of knowledge on the food and beverage industry resulted mature in terms of definitions, the target supply chain, industrial assets, and cyber-threats, but requires future research effort in terms of practical analysis that can fill the emerging gaps in relation to risks, countermeasures, vulnerabilities, solutions and guidelines. The results of our review guided discussions, implications and definition of future research routes.}

Results of analysis outlined the importance of general cybersecurity and policy awareness in shifting employees’ compliance attitude towards enhancing supply chain reactive capability. Using a mixed-method approach, post-survey interviews were further conducted with practitioners in SMEs to understand the study findings. The implications outlined in this study emphasises the importance of prioritising preventive measures and proper employee cyber hygiene to address the risk and loss following a cyber-attack. Key supply chain operational areas in SMEs are still largely supported by the human workforce serving as its backbone. An unwarranted attack could cause adverse business impacts. Thus, practitioners and SMEs would be alerted to the critical need for a robust security posture and that SMEs’ need of the hour lies at the core of its policy and employee cybersecurity hygiene.}

Physical infrastructure design based on Agile project management and minimum viable products provides benefits against the traditional waterfall method. Agile supports an early return on investment that promotes circular reinvesting while making the product more adaptable to variable social-economical environments. However, Agile also presents inherent issues due to its iterative approach. Furthermore, project information requires an efficient record of the aims, requirements, and governance not only for the investors, owners, or users but also to keep evidence in future health & safety and other statutory compliance. In order to address these issues, this article presents a Validation and Verification (V&V) model for data marketplaces with a hierarchical process; each data V&V stage provides a layer of data abstraction, value-added services, and authenticity based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). In addition, this proposed solution applies Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for a decentralised approach where each user keeps and maintains the data within a ledger. The presented model is validated in real data marketplace applications: 1) live data for the Newcastle Urban Observatory Smart City Project, where data are collected from sensors embedded within the smart city via APIs; 2) static data for University College London (UCL)—Real Estate—PEARL Project, where different project users and stakeholders introduce data into a Project Information Model (PIM).}

Hence, the GSCs have started to seek new strategies to be less affected. From this perspective, regionalization of the GSCs may be the best and most practical way to create more strength, well-operating, and robust supply chain systems. When a detailed literature review was performed, two severe and significant gaps were noticed. First is related to the methodological frame. The second gap is also concerned to the criteria used in the previous studies, as it is not clear how these criteria were identified and whether these criteria are suitable to the current real-life decision-making problems. The current paper aims to fill these gaps existing in the literatures. It examines the regionalization potentials of the GSCs and proposes an integrated MCDM framework based on the q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets. Also, it presents updated criteria set that can be commonly accepted. These criteria were identified by performing comprehensive fieldwork with highly experienced professionals with extensive knowledge of the GSCs and a detailed literature review to determine the criteria used in the previous works. The proposed model was applied to evaluate the potential of the southern and eastern European countries to be a manufacturing center for the GSCs. Then, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis performed for validating the proposed MCDM approach approves the proposed model's validity and efficacy by showcasing the close combat among the European countries.}

However, the experts concentrated on a single topic of circular supply chain (CSC), CE, and I4.0, lacking a systemic approach to the integrated context. To this aim, the paper proposes a systematic literature review investigating and systematizing the knowledge around the circular SC domain enabled by CE and I4.0 and, simultaneously, highlighting the major trends. Starting from six dimensions of analysis (Type of contribution, LC phases, I4.0 technologies, Triple Bottom Line (TBL) layers, CE strategies, and SC typologies), CSC-related articles have been classified basing on five thematic categories (I4.0 enabling technologies, Performance tools and indicators, Challenges and barriers, Business models and strategies, Best practices). Results allowed to provide some peculiarities of each category. From a sustainability side, they confirmed a predominance of economic and environmental aspects over social ones, together with a life cycle perspective. From an I4.0 side, they shown a prevalence and a synergic implementation of internet of things, big data analytics, and cloud technologies. From a CE strategy side, reuse-recycle-remanufacturing, waste management, material and energy efficiency have been identified as prevalent topics. The paper contributes in building an integrated knowledge of the threefold CE, CSC and I4.0 research context. In addition, it proposes a theoretical framework useful to gradually guide practitioners in approaching the CSC transition. Depending on different CSC aspects, managers could easily raise their knowledge about practices, methodologies, and technological solutions helpful to support their CSC activities.}

The virus led to a pandemic affecting the physical facilitation of cross border merchandise trade. International trade is augmented with trade documentation and physical verification. Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) as WTO plus agreements between countries have provided bilateral trade opportunities for participating countries. Due to the pandemic, several physical processes shifted to digital mode and people were forced to participate, giving a boost to the digital economy across the world. Developing and under-developed countries were left behind due to a lack of clarity on digital trade provisions in the present WTO framework. Though, RTAs provided much scope for interpreting the existing provisions with innovation for the current times. The present study explores the digital trade provisions in the RTAs and how the pandemic will further push inculcating provisions. The focus is on RTAs that exist in the Asia Pacific region, along with India's perspective. The study identifies the initial digital provisions and collaborations, and evaluates the scope of digital trade.}

En intégrant les formations paramédicales, les universités à composante santé ont la responsabilité sociale de former tous les étudiants en santé, futurs professionnels, pour qu’ils puissent répondre, avec pertinence et efficience, à l’offre de soins attendue de nos concitoyens. La télémédecine et, plus largement, la santé numérique ont pris une place majeure venant bouleverser les pratiques et les organisations du système de soins. Le changement de paradigme des pratiques et organisations médicales, comme les modèles de prise en charge des patients qui sont passés de la pathologie aiguë aux maladies chroniques, incluant la médecine de prévention, impose d’accompagner la formation des professionnels de santé, d’inventer les nouveaux métiers et les nouvelles formations adaptées à la révolution numérique. Ainsi, la formation académique initiale et continue « au numérique » des acteurs de santé est la première étape fondamentale pour pouvoir se former ensuite « par le numérique ». Il s’agit de développer une compréhension des outils, d’adopter un esprit critique quant à leurs usages et de participer à leur élaboration, en co-construction. L’université doit permettre, à tous les étudiants en santé, l’acquisition d’une véritable culture numérique et de compétences permettant la mise en place d’une « littératie numérique » commune à partir d’un programme commun établi et validé en licence. Il est basé sur la certification « PIX » et l’extension à des compétences dans cinq domaines clés que sont la cybersécurité, les données de santé, les outils connectés, la communication et la télésanté. Appuyé sur l’interdisciplinarité entre santé, technologiques-ingénierie et sciences humaines qui sont la force de l’université, le numérique en santé trouve ses valeurs humaines et son sens au service de la santé des usagers. L’enseignement par et pour la recherche de la santé numérique et de la télémédecine ne peut que renforcer les compétences des futurs professionnels, faire émerger de nouveaux métiers comme soutenir l’innovation. Enfin, la santé numérique impose des réflexions éthiques approfondies devant être incluses au cœur même du parcours de formation universitaire. Cette articulation universitaire entre formation et recherche en santé numérique – télémédecine est indispensable pour continuer de faire rayonner le savoir-faire de la médecine française.
Summary
Health universities, by integrating paramedical training, have a social responsibility to train all health students, future professionals, so that they can respond, with relevance and efficiency, to the needs of the health care system of our fellow citizens. Telemedicine and, more broadly, digital health have taken a major role in disrupting the practices and organizations of the healthcare system. The paradigm shift in medical practices and organizations, as well as in patient care models, from acute pathology to chronic diseases and preventive medicine, also requires support for the training of healthcare professionals inventing new professions and new training programs adapted to the digital revolution. Thus, the initial and ongoing academic training of healthcare professionals “in digital technology” is the first fundamental step to be able to be trained “through digital technology”. It is a matter of developing an understanding of the tools, adopting a critical minds regarding their use and participating in their development, in co-construction. The university must enable all health students to acquire a true digital culture and skills that will allow the implementation of a common “digital literacy” based on a common program established and validated in the bachelor's degree program. It is based on the “PIX” certification and the extension to skills in 5 key areas: cybersecurity, health data, connected tools, communication and telehealth. Based on the interdisciplinarity between health, technology-engineering and human sciences, which are the strength of the university, digital health finds its human values and its meaning in the service of users’ health. Teaching digital health and telemedicine through and for research can only strengthen the skills of future professionals, create new professions and support innovation. Finally, digital health requires in-depth ethical reflection that must be included at the very heart of the university training course. This university link between training and research in digital health and telemedicine is essential to continue to promote the expertise of French medicine.}

However, this effect is only unveiled once one accounts in the analysis for the quality of country-level governance institutions, which also makes the relationship stronger. We also find an e-procurement system only to effectively address firm corruption when it benefits from supranational support. The study contributes to the ongoing academic debate on the impact of digitalization on corruption.}

The digital economy implies structural transformation in many industries, including the energy sector, without considering the state specifics of the industry, for which full-fledged digitalization can be harmful. The aim of the study is to develop a methodology and to determine the level of digitalization in the energy sector in an intercountry context. Based on the methods of comparison and analysis, the work analyses the concept of “digitalization” and defines the indicators applied to the assessment of digitalization. The developed methodology is based on the index method, which makes it possible to assess the rating of countries by the level of digitalization in the energy sector. The article discusses modern technological development and socio-economic aspects that determine theoretical research and the development of digitalization in the energy sector. The reasons and stages of digitalization in the energy sector are highlighted. Using the comparison method, the analysis of existing approaches to assessing the digital energy of enterprises is carried out. End-to-end technologies are highlighted, as well as their practical application at the enterprises of the energy sector. An analysis of the key areas for the development of digital energy is presented. Conclusions are made about the feasibility of developing microprograms and the main directions of digitalization are highlighted.}

Although the operational risk of blockchain-integrated systems (BISs) is significant, studies in this area are still conceptual and scarce. This research is a mixed-methods risk analysis focusing on (1) modeling the risk situation by a connected network of potential disruptive events in container shipping BISs, and (2) applying a quantitative risk analysis with probabilistic indexes considering the multiplicity of multi-event risk scenarios (MESs). Thirty-two telephone interviews with experts from container terminal operators, shipping companies, and freight forwarders helped establish a risk network with the description of 25 vertices and 54 directed connections. The quantitative analysis of 64 web survey responses provided insights and foresight about different characteristics of each risk and causal connection. The results enable a comprehensive view of the potential failure modes of blockchain applications. This study is the first to explore the potential risk situation in container shipping BISs with inputs from the industry. The applied methodological framework expands the toolkit of risk researchers, analysts, and managers against the fast-paced development of digitalization in maritime logistics and supply chain operations.}

In sustainability terms, ICT as a whole is estimated to produce up to nearly 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions. As presumed responsible innovators, the HCI community should now consider design strategies that will reduce use and demand for digital technology for the good of both its users and the planet—strategies perhaps even seen as retrogressive in an era where digital technology is constantly implicated in innovation and economic growth. Prior work has noted the potential to design “more moderate” interactions for sustainability, simultaneously addressing negative societal impacts on users’ wellbeing, relationships, productivity at work, and privacy. In this paper, we explore how we may design intentionally moderate digital interactions that retain our participants’ “more meaningful” experiences. We report on the outcomes of two design workshops to uncover experiences of meaningful device and service use, to inform practical designs for ‘moderate and meaningful’ interaction. From this, we offer design recommendations that aim to address the multiple negative impacts that digital technology can create, and discuss the possible barriers to these designs.}

With the development of smart cities, there needs to be a better understanding of how the introduction of smart technologies will affect urban resilience. To address this issue, this article presents a critical review of the literature on smart cities and smart technologies focussing on representations of resilience. The findings reveal that discussing resilience in relation to smart city components of the data layer, digital technologies and the physical city can provide some degree of clarity despite the existence of a multiplicity of definitions and interpretations. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that the nature of relationships between ‘smartness’ and ‘resilience’ remains contested, and largely dependent on the perceived role of digital technologies in resilience-building processes. This in turn is influenced by how these technologies are used and what the intention and expectations are in relation to their use. In order to address these issues, we conclude that further interdisciplinary research, extending to the physical, social and environmental systems of cities, is needed to better understand the relations between smartness and resilience.}

Digitalization improves efficiency and facilitates sophisticated farm management, thus increasing productivity, efficacy, and profitability. At the same time, it promises many opportunities for a more sustainable and, especially, more ecological and cleaner agricultural production. However, with it comes the potential for a number of unintended side effects and risks that may increase the vulnerability of agricultural production and have, thus far, received scant scientific and societal attention. This article presents the results of a two-year transdisciplinary process that aimed to identify unintended side-effects (short “unseens”) and perceived risks of digitalization in German agriculture. Results base on a triangulation of knowledge integration from the transdisciplinary group process involving twelve representatives from science and practice and an ethnographic qualitative meta-analysis. The findings have shown that, despite digitalization's numerous promises for a more ecological and resource efficient agricultural production, a broad range of risks was perceived by some key stakeholders involved. These risks were anticipated to be caused by unintended negative and uncertain side effects on agro-ecological and social systems. Data rights, the restructuring of the value chain with new market concentrations, power structures and dependencies, changing knowledge requirements for farmers (lacking “digital literacy”), and information asymmetries that may cause potentially negative effects on food security were identified as causal factors. Based on these results, we co-developed socially robust orientations (SoROs) for coping with resulting risks and vulnerabilities. We argue that these SoROs provide perspectives on how anticipated knowledge can be turned into responsible action within the RRI (responsible research and innovation) framework. Finally, with regard to the preventive and anticipatory paradigm of “cleaner production”, our transdisciplinary methodology shows a way to adaptively govern the highly complex socio-technological transitions of digitalization in agriculture in the sense of a sustainability-oriented transformation.}

The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 has further increased the urgent need for digital transformation within the health care settings, with the use of artificial intelligence/deep learning, internet of things, telecommunication network/virtual platform, and blockchain. The recent advent of metaverse, an interconnected online universe, with the synergistic combination of augmented, virtual, and mixed reality described several years ago, presents a new era of immersive and real-time experiences to enhance human-to-human social interaction and connection. In health care and ophthalmology, the creation of virtual environment with three-dimensional (3D) space and avatar, could be particularly useful in patient-fronting platforms (eg, telemedicine platforms), operational uses (eg, meeting organization), digital education (eg, simulated medical and surgical education), diagnostics, and therapeutics. On the other hand, the implementation and adoption of these emerging virtual health care technologies will require multipronged approaches to ensure interoperability with real-world virtual clinical settings, user-friendliness of the technologies and clinical efficiencies while complying to the clinical, health economics, regulatory, and cybersecurity standards. To serve the urgent need, it is important for the eye community to continue to innovate, invent, adapt, and harness the unique abilities of virtual health care technology to provide better eye care worldwide.}

abstract = {Smart MicroGrids (SMGs) can be seen as a promising option when it comes to addressing the urgent need for sustainable transition in electric systems from the current fossil fuel-based centralised system to a low-carbon, renewable-based decentralised system. Unlike previous studies that were restricted to a limited number of actors and only took a mono-disciplinary research approach, this current review adopts a multidisciplinary, socio-technical approach and addresses the factors that have been hindering the development of SMGs and considers how these barriers interact. This study contributes to the body of literature on the development of SMGs by mapping and discerning technical, regulatory, market, social and institutional barriers for different types of actors, including technology providers, consumers, Distributed Generation (DG) providers and system operators, based on information derived from laboratory reports, demonstration pilots, and academic journals. In addition, attention is paid to how these barriers interact based on real-life experimentation. A holistic picture of barriers and their interaction is presented as well as recommendations for future research.}

Other socio-technical systems also face the need to transition to become more environmentally and socially sustainable. We argue that such transitions will have both positive and negative security implications on numerous issues which deserve attention but have been little addressed in transition studies. We take a socio-technical lens and propose that these security implications can be ex-ante analysed via three elements of socio-technical systems: technology, actors, and institutions. We provide an illustration of such analysis in the energy transition context and use this to create a categorisation framework for expectations analysis. Regarding the technology dimension, expectations concerning, e.g., resource and technology dependencies, risk for technical system disruptions, and effects on interconnected systems can be analysed as relevant security issues. For the actor dimension, issues such as geopolitical uncertainties, regional (in)stability, internal tensions, and diffusion of power are identified. For institutions, e.g., influence on democratic institutions, peace building and structural violence can be assessed. We argue there is a need for improved and forward-looking policy coordination across domains and for academic studies that utilise foresight approaches to assess different security expectations more concretely.}

A Basic Process Control System (BPCS) is combined with a Safety-Instrumented System (SIS) in a physically integrated form factor using shared resources of some kind. This paper suggests such a strategic choice of technology can result in functional safety (FS) hazards or security vulnerabilities, giving rise to resilience concerns. It takes a sceptical view of such an approach and instead proposes strict segregation of such functions and resources. In the context of critical national infrastructure (CNI), where potentially high consequence events (HCE) may arise from unplanned incidents, the outcome of this paper is to warn against the use of such architecture - even beyond that arena. Both ancient and modern, yet similarly strategic, historical decisions are used as metaphors to illustrate how sometimes insufficiently scrutinised technologies can be later regretted. Practical technical, organisational, and cultural measures are offered to steer against the headwind of commercial pressures in promoting integrated FS and security of the BPCS-SIS environment. A contribution is made of evidence-based, business intelligence gathering measures for BPCS-SIS vendor selection together with a proposal for an alternative, adopted application of proven Uncertainty Assessment Reporting techniques for industrial certification bodies and business stakeholders alike.}

Indeed, SG cyber-physical connectivity is subject to several vulnerabilities that can damage or disrupt its process immunity via cyberthreats. Today's ICSs are experiencing highly complex data change and dynamism, increasing the complexity of detecting and mitigating cyberattacks. Subsequently, and since Machine Learning (ML) is widely studied in cybersecurity, the objectives of this paper are twofold. First, for algorithmic simplicity, a small-scale ML algorithm that attempts to reduce computational costs is proposed. The algorithm adopts a neural network with an augmented hidden layer (NAHL) to easily and efficiently accomplish the learning procedures. Second, to solve the data complexity problem regarding rapid change and dynamism, a label autoencoding approach is introduced for Embedding Labels in the NAHL (EL-NAHL) architecture to take advantage of labels propagation when separating data scatters. Furthermore, to provide a more realistic analysis by addressing real-world threat scenarios, a dataset of an electric traction substation used in the high-speed rail industry is adopted in this work. Compared to some existing algorithms and other previous works, the achieved results show that the proposed EL-NAHL architecture is effective even under massive dynamically changed and imbalanced data.}

Using the measured values of RSSI and SNR at the LoRa gateway, the received power is mathematically modelled which is further considered as an optimization problem. First, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was built and trained to predict the received power. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was further used to find the optimal values of LoRa parameters corresponding to maximum received power.

Democratic politics is, however, slow. So either the political system speeds up decision making at the cost of democracy, or it holds on to democracy at the cost of problem solving. Obviously, neither option is desirable. How do governments try to solve this dilemma and provide positive-sum solutions that are both effective and democratic? We present two so-called paradigm cases of governments, in Denmark and the Netherlands, that have developed a remarkably quick and effective digitalization response to social acceleration. By focusing on four markers – (1) awareness and timing; (2) motivation; (3) new strategic goals; and (4) goal-directed strategic policy action – we theorize how governments aim to solve the dilemma for democratic problem solving under conditions of social acceleration.}

Successful implementation of digital solutions in a given region or country significantly depends on the implementation of this process by Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs). This problem is very well understood in the European Union, where actions are being taken to accelerate this process and build a sustainable and competitive knowledge-based economy. This article addresses this issue by conducting a study of the digital maturity of SMEs among the EU-27 countries. The aim of the study was to determine the level of digital maturity of SMEs in the EU-27 countries as well as whether and how the economic parameters of individual EU countries affect the process of SME digitalization. The adopted objectives determined the developed research methodology and the applied methods. The research was based on data from the Eurostat database, on the basis of which 11 indicators characterizing technologies and digital solutions identified with the Industry 4.0 concept were specified and adopted for the study. The entropy-based Evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) method was used to assess the EU countries in terms of the level of digital maturity of SMEs, and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method was used to analyze similarities between these countries in terms of technologies implemented in SMEs. On the other hand, to determine a relationship between the digital maturity index (digitalization) and the basic economic parameters of the economy, two nonparametric tests (Spearman and Tau Kendall) were utilized. Based on the determined digital maturity index, the EU-27 countries were evaluated in terms of the level of digital maturity of SMEs, dividing them into four groups. The results showed large discrepancies between individual EU-27 countries and between the old (EU-14) and the new (EU-13) EU countries in terms of SMEs digitalization. These results should be widely used to develop a digitalization strategy for the EU economy and policies to improve the degree of digitalization, especially in countries lagging in this area. The universality of the developed methodology creates wide opportunities for its use to study other countries and regions worldwide.}

In light of the resource and knowledge intensiveness of this often multi-year process, this study draws on paradox theory to identify the main organizational tensions emerging and persisting during the Industry 4.0 transformation of companies in a two-step approach. First, a systematic review of 73 academic papers on organizational challenges in Industry 4.0 adoption is conducted that summarizes 35 key challenges. Second, from these challenges a conceptual framework is built that illustrates the main tensions in Industry 4.0 implementation. The identified organizational tensions are categorized according to the learning, organizing, belonging, and performing categories proposed by the paradox theory. Moreover, resolution strategies to address these tensions have been drawn from the reviewed literature. These strategies are presented and linked to the individual tensions. Finally, tensions and resolution strategies were preliminary validated by a group of Industry 4.0 professionals during a workshop. As a result, the findings provide 23 tensions and 18 related resolution strategies illustrating how organizations can address to competing demands simultaneously when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies and thus raise their competitiveness and performance. Based on these results, the article discusses implications for operations management practitioners that can use the proposed framework to inform their strategies and decisions in Industry 4.0 implementation. Moreover, policymakers can adopt the results to develop focussed support actions for driving the Industry 4.0 transition. Finally, four main avenues for future research and implications for operations management scholars are provided.}

abstract = {Owing to the development of industrial internet of things (IIoT) technology, the connectivity and complexity of vehicles have also increased, and new communication technologies have been introduced to in-vehicle networks (IVN). In order to achieve a sufficient level of IIoT cybersecurity, strict ground rules must exist in the critical infrastructures (CI). Traditionally, many legacy communication techniques such as controller area networks (CAN), and FlexRay have been proposed and used for IVN and CI. However, these legacy protocols cannot accommodate advanced IIoT technologies that require high connectivity; hence, Ethernet for vehicles has been introduced in recent years. The phenomenon of introducing Ethernet to IVN is an irreversible industrial trend, such as Ethernet-based Smart Factory, Smart City, and industrial control system based on IIoT. Some automotive Ethernet protocols such as MOST150 and BroadR-Reach have been commercialized primarily for infotainment and are being expanded for providing IIoT services. However, security studies pertaining to automotive Ethernet are incomplete. Even though the amount of data that must be processed by security solutions in the Ethernet environment is increasing, vehicles must be guaranteed ‘hard real-time’. In this study, to reflect the characteristics of IVN security such as real-time, extensibility, and certainty, we establish an IVN simulation environment based on several Ethernet protocols and propose an automatic whitelist generation system. The whitelist performs filtering based on certain criteria, and after it is defined, the time consumed for packet preprocessing is extremely small. The proposed system is designed to create a whitelist through learning to ensure extensibility in an IVN environment composed of heterogeneous networks. The proposed system operates in two stages: the first step automatically generates three types of whitelists, i.e., global, local, and connection, by learning the network; the second step performs filtering by applying the generated rule. The whitelists generated through the proposed system filter out abnormal packets or sections based on the alert levels. The proposed system is expected to cope flexibly with various potential cyber threats on IVNs in the future.}

At the same time, while AI generally has been extolled for contributions to urban resilience, less attention has been paid to the other side of the equation — i.e., to the ethical, governance, and social downsides of AI and big data that can operate to hinder or compromise resilience. With particular attention to relevant institutional dynamics and features, an encompassing and systemic conception of smart and resilient cities is delineated as a critical lens for viewing and analyzing complex instrumental and intrinsic aspects of the relationship between AI and resilience.

abstract = {The Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) is an emerging mobility technology that may hold a paradigm-changing potential for the future of transport policy and planning. Despite a wealth of likely benefits that have made their eventual launch inescapable, CAVs may also be a source of unprecedented disruption for tomorrow's travel eco-systems because of their vulnerability to cyber-threats, hacking and misinformation. CAVs manipulated by users, traffic controllers or third parties may act in deceitful ways. This scene-setting work introduces the deceitful CAV, a vehicle that operates in a deceitful manner towards routing and control functionality for ‘selfish’ or malicious purposes and contextualises its diverse expressions and dimensions. It specifically offers a systematic taxonomy of eight distinctive deceitful behaviours namely: suppression/camouflage, overloading, mistake, substitution, target conditioning, repackaging capability signatures, amplification and reinforcing impression. These as exemplified by their most common attack forms (i.e., starvation, denial-of-service, session hijacking, man-in-the-middle, poisoning, masquerading, flooding and spoofing) are then benchmarked against five key dimensions referring to time frame (short to long duration), engagement (localised to systemic), urban traffic controller infrastructure (single to multiple components), scale (low to high), and impact (low to high). We then suggest mitigation strategies to protect CAV technology against these dangers. These span from purely technological measures referring to the machine-centric triad of vehicles, communication, and control system including adversarial training, heuristic decision algorithms and weighted voting mechanisms to human factor measures that focus on education, training, awareness enhancement, licensing and legislation initiatives that will enable users and controllers to prevent, control or report deceitful activities.}

The objective of this study was to identify existing associations between the adopting I4.0 technologies and their influences on OHS. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) search based in the PRISMA statement was conducted and 59 documents were eligible. The results showed that research is recent and of increasing interest among researchers, mostly from Europe. Despite very limited number of empirical studies, the main sectors that apply I4.0 technologies with impacts on OHS were identified. From the analyzed literature, applications of technologies with potential for positive impacts on OHS were identified, (e.g., safer work environment, healthier workers and mitigation of occupational risks), as well as negative effects on OHS (there is evidence of increased stress, fatigue, diseases, musculoskeletal problems and psychosocial risks). The study also shows gaps and opportunities for future research. These results can help managers in planning, designing and managing the application and integration of technologies related to I4.0 in work environments.}

This is especially critical for food security, as COVID-19 highlighted the vulnerability of food supply chain (FSC). However, Indian organizations are experiencing problems in implementing the integrated form of BLC-IoT due to limited knowledge and insufficient research. The current study aims to propose a conceptual framework to reduce the impact of adoption barriers against BLC-IoT in FSC. Thirteen key barriers were identified after a thorough literature review and consultation with experts. The relationship among barriers was established using Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) methods. The analysis shows that the lack of government regulation and workers' low competency significantly influence BLC-IoT adoption. The results also indicate the intricacy of decision-making by demonstrating that 9 of the 13 barriers were a part of the linkage cluster. The study outcome will help practitioners in developing and planning strategies for effective adoption of BLC-IoT in FSC.}

It explores the role of dynamic analytical frames and a reconsideration of the normative principles of information society policies in overcoming these weaknesses. New instruments and policy arrangements that are considered include the establishment of boundary conditions (“guardrails”) for players, reliance on adaptive forms of policy, and reliance on ethics across all layers of governance. Driven by the global heterogeneity of values and the diversity of historical, economic, political, and cultural conditions, national and global governance arrangements will likely become more multi-centric. To avoid regulatory drift and fragmentation, policy must strive to create dynamic learning systems that help to continuously improve information society governance.}

However, it may also conversely cause excessive energy consumption if not managed well. Nowadays, digitalization has been widely adopted in ASEAN, not only in the economic sector but also in social activities. This development is believed to improve the energy efficiency towards energy sustainability in the long-run. As digitalization is closely related to energy use behavior that will consequently promote energy efficiency and sustainability, comprehensive statistical analysis is essential to uncover the truth and debunk incorrect potential energy consumption behavioral patterns of digitalization and its effects on energy consumption. This study investigates the impact of digitalization on both total and disaggregated energy consumption. We use a balance panel dataset that covers 1990-2018 in five major ASEAN countries. The Cross-Sectional Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) approach is employed to estimate both long run and short run elasticity of digitalization. The results conclude that digitalization does indeed bring down energy consumption levels in total and in all disaggregated sources. Hence, more investment into increasing and enhancing digital infrastructure is recommended towards achieving energy sustainability strategic objectives.}

We conducted an online survey with individuals who have experience watching any deepfake content, and we analyzed the model using the PLS-SEM method by SmartPLS 3.0. The results showed that previous perceptions about sexual harassment and K-pop idols, experiences viewing pornographic content, and gender were crucial predictors of viewers' emotions toward K-pop idols' deepfake porn videos. Media exposure and age, however, did not have significant effects on users' emotional responses. The results also indicated the substantial positive effects of anger on the coping behaviors of problem solving and emotional support. Guilt, on the other hand, was not associated with either behavioral response measured. This study represents the first attempt to empirically investigate individuals’ negative feelings toward and reactions to content generated by novel and maliciously exploited technology. It also highlights the necessity of collaboration among government, industry, and education to address deepfakes of a sexual nature.}

abstract = {Spearheaded by major technology companies (Big Tech), digital platforms have rapidly become key infrastructures for accumulation under global financialized capitalism, with consumer convenience and underlying practices of data collection, control and analysis giving rise to platform finance. While financial institutions are partnering with financial technology (FinTech) start-ups to digitally enclose customers, American and Chinese Big Techs increasingly mobilize their platforms to offer payment services, next to expanding their platformed services to financial incumbents. Observing the growing dependence of finance on American Big Tech platforms, this paper investigates how the shift toward platform finance in the European Union (EU) unfolds as a state-mediated and power-laden process between mostly ‘domestic’ (EU) financial incumbents and ‘foreign’ (non-EU) Big Tech firms. The starting point of the analysis is the European Strategy for Data launched by the European Commission in 2020. Through document analysis, we reconstruct the circulation of code words within ‘the Brussels Bubble’ in anticipation of- and in direct response to the proposal. We find that, despite its implication in the global financial crisis, incumbent EU finance presents itself as a fix for non-EU platform domination by Big Tech. The ‘technological sovereignty’ of the EU is marshalled by incumbent finance to defend market share as would-be pan-European digital financial champions. The Big Tech ‘threat’ is thereby transformed into an argument for strategic deregulation and forced data sharing by Big Tech for the sake of maintaining a ‘level playing field’. The outcome of these processes of strategic coupling is an alignment between the interests of EU data protection and the commercial interests of platformizing European banks.}

Making cities smarter implies not only technological innovation and deployment, but also having smart people and effective policies. Cities can acquire knowledge and incorporate governance lessons from other jurisdictions to develop smart city initiatives that are unique to the local contexts. We conducted two rounds of surveys involving 23 experts on an e-Delphi platform to consolidate their opinion on factors that facilitate policy transfer among smart cities. Findings show a consensus on the importance of six factors: having a policy entrepreneur; financial instruments; cities’ enthusiasm for policy learning; capacity building; explicit regulatory mechanisms; and policy adaptation to local contexts. Correspondingly, three policy recommendations were drawn. Formalizing collaborative mechanisms and joint partnerships between cities, setting up regional or international networks of smart cities, and establishing smart city repositories to collect useful case studies for urban planning and governance lessons will accelerate policy transfer for smart city development. This study sheds light on effective ways policymakers can foster policy learning and transfer, especially when a jurisdiction's capacity is insufficient to deal with the uncertainties and challenges ahead.}

The use of behavioural biometrics can be used to supplement these credentials to provide a greater level of assurance in the identity of an authenticated user. However, user behaviours can also be used to ascertain other identifiable information about an individual. In this paper we build upon the notion of keystroke dynamics (the analysis of typing behaviours) to infer an anonymous user’s name and predict their native language. This work found that there is a discernible difference in the ranking of bigrams (based on their timing) contained within the name of a user and those that are not. As a result we propose that individuals will reliably type information they are familiar with in a discernibly different way. In our study we found that it should be possible to identify approximately a third of the bigrams forming an anonymous users name purely from how (not what) they type.}

The paper then presents a cross-national analysis of the outcomes of CEAT on internet use based on comparative data from 80 nations. Controlling for contextual variables, such as the wealth of the nations and scale of internet use, the analysis shows a positive and statistically significant impact of CEAT on the vitality of internet use and services, as well as a distribution of CEAT scores that indicates key issues for low-income and developing nations. A qualitative analysis of responses from these nations is used to identify key reasons for their levels of maturity in this area. While recognising key limitations of these findings, it offers suggestions for policy and practice to meet the need for effective programs for education, awareness raising, and training. In addition, the research suggests the need for more detailed indicators of CEAT initiatives in more nations and over time to assess the validity of the findings and the recommendations for policy and practice in this area of capacity building offered in this paper.}

We use six diverse measures to reflect the circularity of European countries: municipal waste, the number of circularity patents, circular material usage, recycle waste rate, recycling biowaste rate, and recycling e-waste rate. In order to assess digital businesses, we use four measures of e-Commerce – online selling, e-Commerce sales, e-Commerce web sales, and e-Commerce turnover – and two measures of e-Business: customer relation management usage and cloud usage. We use user-centricity and key enablers to assess digital public services. Our estimation results reveal that the initial development of digitalization can enable European countries to transit to the circular economy. However, the overdevelopment of digitalization hinders this process. By contrast, we present a nonlinear relationship between digitalization and circularity, suggesting that digitalization can positively impact the circularity level after reaching a certain level.}

The pharmaceutical supply chain processes are considered as the mediators and the emerging technology adoption barriers are proposed as the moderators. The study is evaluated using a survey of pharmaceutical companies in India. The findings indicate that manufacturing, distribution and consumption processes in the supply chain mediate the effects of emerging technologies on supply chain performance; however, mediating effects are weakened due to the presence of intricate barriers. This study thereby empirically investigates the interplay between emerging technologies in pharmaceutical supply chain performance and provides managerial insights with a proposed research framework on how to incorporate and encourage Pharma 4.0 for achieving sustainability in the supply chains.}

This study highlights that the majority of workers experience a negative economic–financial impact due to the additional costs incurred for digital technology and platforms and for utilities as well as the non-payment of overtime and meal vouchers, which are higher than the savings in commuting costs and out-of-pocket expenses. Furthermore, this research emphasizes that psychological–behavioural variables, specifically job satisfaction and technostress, are essential in the choice to continue working remotely after the COVID-19 pandemic.

abstract = {Information and communication technology (ICT) is expected to stimulate economic growth and mitigate adverse environmental effects. However, studies of ICT's effects on the economy and environment have shown inconsistent results. This study investigates and interprets this research gap. It begins with a systematic assessment of 108 investigations into the economic and environmental effects of ICT, published between 1978 and 2022, and groups these into three categories. Thereafter, a meta-analysis is used to investigate the factors underlying the outcome disparities. The meta-analysis finds that the research scope, measurement approach, data availability, and analytical tool selection have been the most significant contributors to the variability of ICT's measured impacts. This study then provides a preliminary analytical framework for the ICT-economic-environmental nexus, which is used to discuss three mechanisms and to explain the disparities in previous studies. It concludes that ignoring the relevant system and its interaction effects will lead to a skewed evaluation of ICT's implications. This analysis explains the inconsistency and incommensurability in most existing literature. Additionally, it provides indices of economic and environmental systems and demonstrates the direct, indirect, and rebound effects of ICTs on the environment and economy. Finally, it addresses the implications of this paradigm for policymakers and academicians and recommends related avenues for future research.}

abstract = {The technologies of the fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR/Industry 4.0) have been a technological catalyst for all fields of human endeavor, permeating the water, energy, and food (WEF) nexus. However, there is no empirical evidence of the extent of applications and the permeability level in ensuring the three resources’ security. This study explored the relationship of the fourth industrial revolution technologies and the water, energy, and food nexus by evaluating the applications of the various technologies of 4IR on WEF nexus and examined the effect of 4IR on WEF nexus. The objectives were achieved using the qualitative methodology and bibliometric analysis of content analysis. The result showed that most fourth industrial revolution technologies had not been integrated with the WEF nexus. The result showed that only the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data analytics had permeated the nexus, which shows that data of the resources will be the foundation of the nexus. The systematic collection, accuracy of data, and empirical analysis of data will determine the level of security of WEF nexus. The qualitative results show that there are applications of the fourth industrial revolution technologies to the individual sectors of the nexus, birthing Water 4.0, Energy 4.0, and Food 4.0. The Bibliometric analysis result shows that the integration of the fourth industrial revolution with the WEF nexus will lead to cleaner production practices relating to the technological processes of water, energy, and food resources. These practices will ensure the environment's safety from WEF wastes and the water, energy, and food security in production processes. The empirical research and bibliometric analysis result, rooted in the concept of cleaner production, shows that the fourth industrial revolution affected the WEF nexus. The effects are; the birth of clean technologies & industrial applications, the catalyst for sustainability security of WEF nexus leveraging on life cycle thinking, enablement of technological transfer, enhancement of economic growth, and urban planning. The study concludes that the fourth industrial revolution technologies affect WEF nexus, ensuring the popularization of cleaner production strategies and processes of the resources during trade-offs and synergies. The study recommends the integration of a cleaner production concept in WEF processing. It should follow the innovation diffusion theory (IDT) and Technology acceptance theory (TAM) when applying 4IR technologies to the nexus of water, energy, and food resources, for their sustainable security.}

Consequently, corporations adopt Enterprise Mobile Systems (EMS) to facilitate employees working from home, ensuring security and privacy. Notwithstanding the business benefits of EMS, the adoption rate of these solutions by employees is significantly low. Traditional theories on technology adoption do not explain why some employees choose to use EMS through their mobile devices to access official applications, while others refrain. This study uses construal level theory and rational choice theory to examine the role of use contexts and intention to comply with EMS policy on employees' decision to adopt EMS. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was applied. A mixed approach was followed for this study and analysis was done based on country-wide cross-sectional survey of 330 professionals engaged with reputed information technology companies. The results highlight that employees’ use contexts and intentions to comply with the EMS policy are strong antecedents of adapting to new systems. The results also reinforce that policy awareness positively affects the intention to comply with EMS policies, impacting employee engagement and task performance.}

Digital health solutions, with apps, virtual care, and electronic medical records, are gaining momentum across all medical disciplines, and their adoption has been accelerated, in part, by the COVID-19 pandemic. Personal wearables, sensors, and mobile technologies are increasingly being used to identify health risks and assist in diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of health and disease. Genomics is a vanguard of digital healthcare as we witness a convergence of the fields of genomic and digital medicine. Spurred by the acute need to increase health literacy, empower patients’ preference-sensitive decisions, or integrate vast amounts of complex genomic data into the clinical workflow, there has been an emergence of digital support tools in genomics-enabled care. We present three use cases that demonstrate the application of these converging technologies: digital genomics decision support tools, conversational chatbots to scale the genetic counseling process, and the digital delivery of comprehensive genetic services. These digital solutions are important to facilitate patient-centered care delivery, improve patient outcomes, and increase healthcare efficiencies in genomic medicine. Yet the development of these innovative digital genomic technologies also reveals strategic challenges that need to be addressed before genomic digital health can be broadly adopted. Alongside key evidentiary gaps in clinical and cost-effectiveness, there is a paucity of clinical guidelines, policy, and regulatory frameworks that incorporate digital health. We propose a research agenda, guided by learning healthcare systems, to realize the vision of digital health-enabled genomics to ensure its sustainable and equitable deployment in clinical care.}

We categorize these barriers using the Technology-Organization-Environment framework. We conclude that barriers related to standardization and lack of off-the-shelf solutions are considered root barriers. Our results differ from other studies that regard barriers related to legal and contractual uncertainty with the highest driving power and lowest dependence power. Also, we find that organizational barriers have the highest dependency and lowest driving power, contradicting studies on the topic. We provide recommendations for managers and policymakers in three areas: Standardization Dissemination, Infrastructure Development, and Digital Strategy.}

Among the researchers, there has been a significant focus on identifying, mitigating, and managing the risks that affect the supply chain (SC). Though the research on SCRM remains for an extended period, still the industries are facing difficulties in managing the SC risks. Also, the SC managers have begun to focus on decision-making based on numerous data sources for predicting the uncertainties more accurately to achieve a proactive and predictive intelligent risk management mechanism. These attributes make Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) suitable techniques in the SCRM field. The application of these techniques in SCRM is in a nascent stage. In this view, this paper presents a systematic and descriptive review of the literature and identifies the various AI and ML methods applied in different phases related to SCRM. Also, it investigates the different categories of SC risks and the existing articles based on the AI technique used. This analysis focuses on research articles related to SCRM from three scientific databases published between 2010 and 2021 for detailed study.

This study examines how the industrial sector can transform technological innovations toward renewable electricity procurement. We consider two strategies for manufacturers: purchasing electricity from a technology-based supplier (TB strategy) and purchasing it from a non-technology-based supplier (NTB strategy). Manufacturers need technological transformation, such as upgrading their electrical system toward digitalization to manage power outages. We examine manufacturers’ pricing decisions and their long-term behavior to adopt the TB and NTB strategies using a one-population evolutionary game-theoretic approach. Also, we investigate the majority of manufacturers’ population that eventually choose the best strategy. Moreover, we apply the present model to real-world cases of Iran’s cement, steel, and paper industries. The results show that the evolutionary behavior of sectors with high annual electricity consumption, such as steel, converges to the TB strategy faster than cement and paper industries. In contrast, the cement and paper industries are more sensitive to subsidy allocation than the steel industry with respect to electricity procurement strategies.}

Much of the academic interest surrounding the emergence of new digital technologies has focused on forwarding the engineering literature, concentrating on the potential opportunities (economic, innovation, etc.) and harms (ethics, climate, etc.), with less focus on the foundational and theoretical shifts brought about by these technologies (e.g., what are “digital things”? What is the ontological nature and state of phenomena produced by and expressed in terms of digital products? Are there distinctions between the traditional conceptions of digital and non-digital technologies?. We investigate the question of what value is being expressed by an algorithm, which we conceptualize in terms of a digital asset, defining a digital asset as a valued digital thing that is derived from a particular digital technology (in this case, an algorithmic system). Our main takeaway is to invite the reader to consider artificial intelligence as a representation of the capture of value sui generis and that this may be a step change in the capture of value vis à vis the emergence of digital technologies.}

Data science is typically the scientific study and analysis of actual happenings with historical data using a variety of scientific methodologies, machine learning techniques, processes, and systems. In this paper, we concentrate on and explore “Smart City Data Science”, where city data collected from various sources such as sensors, Internet-connected devices, or other external sources, is being mined for insights and hidden correlations to enhance decision-making processes and deliver better and more intelligent services to citizens. To achieve this goal, artificial intelligence, particularly, machine learning analytical modeling can be employed to provide deeper knowledge about city data, which makes the computing process more actionable and intelligent in various real-world city services. Finally, we identify and highlight ten open research issues for future development and research in the context of data-driven smart cities. Overall, we aim to provide an insight into smart city data science conceptualization on a broad scale, which can be used as a reference guide for the researchers, industry professionals, as well as policy-makers of a country, particularly, from the technological point of view.}

However, the continued depletion of wild fish stocks is leading to increased strain on the aquaculture sector in terms of sustaining the supply of fish and seafood to global markets. Despite the fact that aquaculture is more diversified than other agriculture sectors, there are significant pressures on the industry to continue innovating in order to enable sustainability including increased fish production, improved appropriate selection of species, disease mitigation, reduced wastage, preventing environmental pollution and generating more employment globally. This viewpoint article addresses how digital transformation can help support and meet expansion needs of the fisheries/aquaculture industries that includes exploiting and harnessing ICT, IoT, Cloud-edge computing, AI, machine learning, immersive technologies and blockchain. Digital technologies are bringing significant operational benefits for global food chain, improving efficiencies and productivity, reducing waste, contamination and food fraud. The focus on digital technologies has recently evolved to Industry 5.0 where AI and robotics are coupled with the human mind in order to advance human-centric solutions. This viewpoint describes the role of Quadruple helix Hub (academic-industry-government and society) in delivering a convergent holistic approach to meeting the diversity of fishery industry needs by connecting and placing fisheries centrally in a defined ecosystem of stakeholders. This includes specialist training, testing technologies, providing access to finance and fostering disruption through aquaculture accelerator initiatives such as that provided by Hatch Blue. Connecting digital Innovation Hubs trans-regionally, nationally and internationally will also help mitigate against significant risks for the fisheries and aquaculture industry including climate change, global pandemics and conflicts that can jeopardize fish and seafood production and supply chains. There is also a commensurate need to avail of digital technologies in order to increase awareness of key industry issues across the value chain, such as through social marketing. Thus, addressing key challenges by way of the global digital transformation of fishery and aquaculture industry will meet several sustainable development goals of the United Nations catered around the application of disruptive technology.}

HAR aims to detect the person performing the action on an unknown video sequence, determine the action's duration, and identify the action type. The main idea of HAR in sports is to monitor a player's performance, that is, to detect the player, track their movements, recognize the performed action, compare various actions, compare different kinds and skills of acting performances, or make automatic statistical analysis. As an action that can occur in the sports field refers to a set of physical movements performed by a player in order to complete a task using their body or interacting with objects or other persons, actions can be of different complexity. Because of that, a novel systematization of actions based on complexity and level of performance and interactions is proposed. The overview of HAR research focuses on various methods performed on publicly available datasets, including actions of everyday activities. That is just a good starting point; however, HAR is increasingly represented in sports and is becoming more directed towards recognizing similar actions of a particular sports domain. Therefore, this paper presents an overview of HAR applications in sports primarily based on Computer Vision as the main contribution, along with popular publicly available datasets for this purpose.}

Using collaborative governance frameworks and comparative case study of three cases of digital government in the Mexican states of Mexico, Puebla, and Yucatan, we extend current understanding of key determinants of effective inter-agency collaborations in digital government settings. In particular, our research question is as follows: how do leadership, governance, technology, and collaborative capacity and competencies contribute to effective collaboration? Our results indicate that all four components are important, but in different ways. Laws and regulations appear to play an important role supporting governance of the inter-agency networks in our three cases. In addition, multi-level leadership, formal governance, implementation flexibility, the role of technology as a social actor in itself, and trust building based on expertise seem to be particularly salient.}

Investigating the economic effects of Industry 4.0, especially at the corporate level, has been a cutting-edge research topic across various disciplines. Similarly, several studies have addressed the opportunities that Industry 4.0 might offer to environmental sustainability. On the contrary, the social sustainability implications of Industry 4.0 are less explored in the literature. Unlike the overoptimism around the economic benefits, academia remains quite inconsistent while interpreting the social aspects linked to Industry 4.0. Trying to shed some light on this issue, this research conducts a state-of-the-art systematic review of academic papers and a Machine Learning-based analysis of grey literature on the social implications of Industry 4.0. Contributing to this very relevant and fresh topic, the study summarizes the ongoing trends on social sustainability consequences of Industry 4.0, highlights the existing gaps, and proposes exciting avenues for future research.}

The Industry 4.0 concept originated in manufacturing but has evolved over recent years and extended beyond the limits of the focal company to embrace the entire supply chain. This study applies a variety of techniques sequentially. First, the initial phases of a Systematic Literature Review are applied to identify, select, and evaluate documents for analysis. Subsequently, Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language Processing techniques are applied to identify research topics and group articles. Lastly, bibliometric analysis techniques are applied using an innovative tool that enables dynamic data association. A total of 41 research topics are identified that produce a grouping of 663 articles in 8 clusters. The obtained results are used for an analysis of the extant literature, the detection of gaps, and proposals to guide future research in the Industry 4.0 and supply chain sphere.}

abstract = {The world is heading in the wrong direction on carbon emissions where we are not on track to limit global warming to 1.5 °C; Ireland is among the countries where overall emissions have continued to rise. The development of wettable peatland products and services (termed ‘Paludiculture’) present significant opportunities for enabling a transition away from peat-harvesting (fossil fuels) to developing ‘green’ eco-innovations. However, this must be balanced with sustainable carbon sequestration and environmental protection. This complex transition from ‘brown to green’ must be met in real time by enabling digital technologies across the full value chain. This will potentially necessitate creation of new green-business models with the potential to support disruptive innovation. This timely paper describes digital transformation of paludiculture-based eco-innovation that will potentially lead to a paradigm shift towards using smart digital technologies to address efficiency of products and services along with future-proofing for climate change. Digital transform of paludiculture also aligns with the ‘Industry 5.0 - a human-centric solution’. However, companies supporting peatland innovation may lack necessary standards, data-sharing or capabilities that can also affect viable business model propositions that can jeopardize economic, political and social sustainability. Digital solutions may reduce costs, increase productivity, improve produce develop, and achieve faster time to market for paludiculture. Digitisation also enables information systems to be open, interoperable, and user-friendly. This constitutes the first study to describe the digital transformation of paludiculture, both vertically and horizontally, in order to inform sustainability that includes process automation via AI, machine learning, IoT-Cloud informed sensors and robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain for cyber-physical systems. Thus, the aim of this paper is to describe the applicability of digital transformation to actualize the benefits and opportunities of paludiculture activities and enterprises in the Irish midlands with a global orientation.}

The COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, has exposed the fragility of global supply chains in many sectors. Given these concerns, supply chain networks, including those designed based on the principles of lean philosophies, are increasingly being re-examined as firms grapple with the challenge of strengthening the capacity to withstand, absorb, and rebound from unexpected shocks. Addressing the urgency of this imperative, this study presents a novel framework—based on theories and concepts in the systems engineering (SE) and supply chain resilience domains to enhance the resilience implementation capabilities that are lacking in many of today's firms. By applying a Grounded Theory methodology, this study develops and validates a conceptual model that identifies six core attributes fundamental to developing resilience capabilities in complex supply chains. The study concludes by providing examples of, and insights into, the role of these attributes in building supply chain resilience.}

One of the ways in which socio-technical imaginaries filter into policymaking is, it turns out, by informing an image of the consumer which serves to justify measures for the realization of a desired future. In particular, the documents offer a view of the consumer as an actor that is empowered by digitisation. The thesis of this paper is that this view of the consumer is partial: the rhetoric of consumer technological empowerment outweighs and conceals much needed considerations about the vulnerability of consumers vis-a-vis data-intensive payment technologies. Ultimately, the fault lies with the future imaginaries upon which such image is grounded. The vision of the digital payment infrastructure portrayed in the documents is in fact problematic for two reasons. First, the technologies that are portraited as desirable are chosen based on industry interests and trends rather than considerations of benefits and risks that these technologies entail. Secondly, the assumption that a liberalized market will offer more and better choices is flawed, as platformisation entails risks of monopolization and abuses of market power. We suggest that policymakers in this domain should be more critical of the risks entailed by platformisation, and open their imagination to alternative technological futures.}

Through an analysis of secondary data collected from a systematic review of the 4IR literature, we build on Lall's (1992) and Bell and Pavitt's (1995) frameworks, to develop an updated framework of firm-level technological capabilities which accounts for the refined set of human and organizational activities and resources required by firms for the uptake of 4IR technologies and processes along their digital transformation journey. The framework proposes four levels of increasingly complex technological capabilities across six thematic groups of technological and organizational functions. The framework represents an initial basis for examining the micro-level capabilities required by firms to launch, endorse and actualize the 4IR. Our analysis leads to a definition of 4IR firm-level technological capabilities which better reflects the new realities of this revolution. We discuss the implications of the proposed framework, and we conclude with the contributions of our study from the academic, policy and management perspectives.}

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate Saudi parents’ privacy concerns regarding their children’s smart device applications (apps). To this end, we conducted a survey and analysed 119 responses. Our results show that Saudi parents expressed a high level of concern regarding their children’s privacy when using smart device apps. However, they expressed higher concerns about apps’ content than privacy issues such as apps’ requests to access sensitive data. Furthermore, parents’ concerns are not in line with most of the children’s installed apps, which contain apps inappropriate for their age, require parental guidance, and request access to sensitive data such as location. We also discuss several aspects of Saudi parents’ practices and concerns compared to those reported by Western (mainly from the UK) and Chinese parents in previous reports. We found interesting patterns and established new relationships. For example, Saudi and Chinese children have a higher level of autonomy in installing apps on their devices than Western children who mostly request apps installation from their parents. However, there are more Saudi parents who end up uninstalling apps from their children’s devices due to privacy concerns than Western parents. This suggests that parents’ involvement in installing children’s apps is related to a reduced number of uninstallation incidents, which are mostly negatively received by children. Furthermore, Saudi and Western parents show higher levels of privacy concerns than Chinese parents. Finally, we tested 14 privacy practices and concerns against high versus low socioeconomic classes (parents’ education, technical background, and income) to find whether there are significant differences between high and low classes (we denote these differences by “digital divide”). Out of 42 tests (14 properties × 3 classes) we found significant differences between high and low classes in 7 tests only. While this is a positive trend overall, it is important to work on bridging these gaps. The results of this paper provide key findings to identify areas of improvement and recommendations, especially for Saudis, which can be used by parents, developers, researchers, regulators, and policy makers.}

To make this a reality, analyzing of drawbacks of the present research environment and finding solutions through digital interventions is warranted. This paper elaborates on those issues faced by researchers who are isolated from human-to-human physical contact in carrying out research in commercial agriculture, especially in COVID-19. Further, a conceptual model to connect and practice research beyond physical presence by digital transformations of organization design of research institutes under these circumstances is suggested. The framework proposed characterizes a connected lab complex – designated as the “Smart Lab Bubble”, to examine its potential in meeting the real needs of a researcher in a disconnected society to produce impactful research for the agriculture sector. It emphasizes the fact that this kind of model shall resiliently be adopted in technological sciences, with the backing from those non-technological sciences like economics, humanities, and management, to make the concept of a “society-friendly innovative research culture” a reality. In light of this, it would expect to leverage technologies to create new services and values for various stakeholders including the agriculture community during this pandemic. The digitally endorsed performance management envisaged under this framework, along with relevant policy measures, is supposed to be building an agile architecture that would not incur technical debt in a newly formed cultural position.}

The authors interviewed learners, trainers, and managers from the company. The originality lies in the comparison of five different training methods: face-to-face, videoconference, non-tutored e-learning, tutored e-learning, and serious games. The qualitative study reveals that serious games create value according to five dimensions: conception, optimization, cognition, emotion, and socialization. The four recommendations are: (1) to integrate serious games into a wide-ranging training protocol; (2) to balance face-to-face and distance-learning phases; (3) to assess knowledge transfer and to check that learners can use what they learned in the real world; and (4) to ensure learner self-awareness and enhance cognitive engagement. The quantitative study suggests that value ​​created by serious games is significantly different from value ​​created by other learning methods. Additionally, managers recognize significantly higher value creation ​​than trainers and learners.}

While most research on blockchain energy applications has been from the technological lens, this paper contributes with a multi-dimensional approach. The interrelatedness among these dimensions is one of the key messages of this paper. Both corporate strategy and public policy development need to integrate user behavior research, business model innovation and regulatory experimentation for a holistic approach in understanding and implementing blockchain, and other emerging technologies.

An exhaustive literature review is conducted to identify the main criteria affecting social, economic and environmental sustainability in the photovoltaic energy supply chain, and to explore the potential impact of Industry 4.0 on sustainability. Subsequently, three Fuzzy Inference Systems combining quantitative and qualitative data are built to calculate the supply chain's social, economic and environmental sustainability. Experts' opinions are used to identify the impact of Industry 4.0 technologies on the three pillars of sustainability for each supply chain stage. Finally, a novel sustainability index, Sustainability Index 4.0, is formulated to compute the overall sustainability of the photovoltaic energy supply chain in seven countries. The results show the applicability and usefulness of the proposed holistic model in helping policy makers, stakeholders and users to make informed decisions for the development of sustainable renewable energy supply chains, taking into account the impact of Industry 4.0 and digital technologies.}

Interfaces to digital twins are projected to go beyond physical representations to become blueprints for the actual “objects” and an active dashboard for their control. The role and importance of real-time interactive animations presented in an Extended Reality (XR) format will be explored. The need for using game engines, particularly their physics engines and AI within interactive simulated Extended Reality is expanded on. Importing and scanning real-world environments is assumed to become more efficient when using AR. Exporting to VR and AR is recommended to be a default feature. A technology framework for the next generation simulators is presented along with a proposed set of implementation guidelines. The need for more human centric technology approaches, nascent in Industry 4.0, are now central to the emerging Industry 5.0 paradigm; an agenda that is discussed in this research as part of a human in the loop future, supported by DES. The potential role of Explainable Artificial Intelligence is also explored along with an audit trail approach to provide a justification of complex and automated decision-making systems with relation to DES. A technology framework is proposed, which brings the above together and can serve as a guide for the next generation of holistic simulators for manufacturing.}

However, customers are often reluctant to grant data access. Although prior research has identified lack of data access as an inhibitor of digital servitization, the peculiarities of data exchange in digital servitization have not been considered until now. Therefore, it remains unclear which intra- and interorganizational challenges emerge within and between providers and customers that lead to lack of data access. This study uses paradox theory to address the complex and multi-faceted phenomenon of data access in digital servitization. Specifically, 40 in-depth interviews with managers across a wide range of industries revealed four paradoxes inhibiting data access and comprising one overarching interorganizational paradox in the form of (1) the need for access vs. the need for shielding, and three intra-organizational paradoxes in the form of (2) product-focused identity vs. digital-focused identity, (3) data appreciation vs. data depreciation, and (4) goodwill perception vs. opportunism perception. To address each paradox, this study also provides a comprehensive set of coping strategies. The findings may help providers facilitate their digital servitization efforts by addressing the identified data access paradoxes that they and their customers face.}

abstract = {Since an increasing number of daily activities are carried out online, an exclusion or limited access to the Internet prevent citizens from entering a world full of opportunities that cannot be accessed otherwise; in this sense, inclusion in the digital realm is strictly connected to social inclusion. Digital inclusion is not conceived as a mere dichotomy, access versus no access, but in terms of the degree to which e-inclusion improve wellbeing for individuals, community and society. Using a quantitative method based on a multivariate analysis, multiple correspondence analysis and cluster analysis, applied to a representative sample of UK citizens, this article sheds light onto the gradual process of digital inclusion, highlighting how social and digital inclusion are intertwined and how people who have one or more social or economic vulnerabilities are more likely to be in the group of those who are digitally excluded.}

abstract = {The impediments to Industry 4.0 adoption in sustainable production function as a roadblock to the digital transformation of manufacturing companies. The study's goal is to look at the intricate of Industry 4.0's impediments to the advancement of digital manufacturing for long-term sustainability. Adoption of Industry 4.0 is challenging in the current environment, but the consideration of Industry 4.0 in the sustainability industry is much more difficult. The empirical investigation followed a mixed-methods approach, which included the systematic literature review (SLR) method and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The thirty sustainability impediments relating to technological, organizational, economic, environmental, social, and institutional factors were identified using the SLR approach, and the AHP method (a multi-criteria decision-making method) was used to rank or prioritize the synchronized impediments. Based on the results from all six categories of impediments, the study found the organizational (compound priority weight 0.413) impediments of Industry 4.0 are the most prominent impediment to sustainability measures for digital manufacturing. It was followed by the Environmental, Technological, Economical, Societal and institutional impediments, with compound priority weights of 0.256, 0.152, 0.099, 0.054 and 0.026 respectively that represent the sequence of these impediments. Overall, the study reveals a 360-degree overview of the organization in order to identify Industry 4.0 factors for digital transformation. By examining the sustainability factors and challenges of Industry 4.0, the study assists company managers in revolutionizing their businesses into digitally-enabled ones. Furthermore, this study also helps managers and practitioners to prioritize the various sustainability factors that are most relevant for their organization when they try to transform digitally their business.}
