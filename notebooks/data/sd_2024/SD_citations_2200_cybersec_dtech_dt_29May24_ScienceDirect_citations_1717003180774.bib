abstract = {Recently, the concept of the smart city has gained growing popularity. As cities worldwide have set the aim to harness digital technologies to their development, increasing focus came to lie on the potential challenges and concerns related to data-driven urban practices. In the existing literature, these challenges and concerns have been dominantly approached from a pragmatic approach based on the a priori assumed ‘goodness’ of the smart city; for a small group of critics, the very notion of the smart city is questionable. This paper takes the middle-way by interrogating how municipal and civil society stakeholders problematize the challenges and concerns related to data-driven practices in five Dutch cities, and how they act on these concerns in practice. The lens of problematization posits that the ways of problematizing data-driven practices contribute to their actual enactment, and that this is an inherently political process. The case study shows that stakeholders do not only perceive practical challenges but are widely aware of and are (partly) pro-actively engaging with perceived normative-ethical and societal concerns, leading to different (sometimes inter-related) technological, legal/political, organizational, informative and participative strategies. Nonetheless, the explicit contestation of smart city policies through these strategies remains limited in scope. The paper argues that more research is needed to uncover the structural-institutional dynamics that facilitate and/or prevent the repoliticization of smart city projects.}

In short, the uninhibited explosion of digitized systems and connected devices pour out a tremendous amount of multi-structured data and the impending challenge is to make sense out of the data heaps. Data analytics is the way to go and in the recent past, the overwhelming trend is to empower our everyday systems with machine and deep learning algorithms to automatically learn out of data heaps and streams in order to be distinctively intelligent in their actions and reactions. This chapter is specially prepared to put a stimulating foundation for explaining the nitty-gritty of the Digital Twin paradigm.}

This research investigates the conjoint effect of three potential sources of PSS’s competitive advantage: the type of PSS, i.e. a value proposition directed at a market segment based on specific customer behaviour, the core resources, competences and organizational processes on which the PSS’s business model is based and their level of protection from competitor’s replication. We adopted a multiple case study methodology to take into account the complex interrelation of the variables characterizing the phenomenon investigated by sampling 10 companies and collecting data by means of semi-structured interviews. Results of within- and cross-case analysis reveal that Use-Oriented PSS business models gain a competitive advantage from physical resources and organizational processes, whether protected against replication threat or not, while Result-Oriented PSS business models from people competences. Human capital is fundamental also for Product-Oriented PSS business models, but companies can reach a competitive advantage only if protected against replication threat from competitors. The paper contributes to the expanding PSS literature by identifying potentially distinctive factors of the PSS business model and by providing useful considerations on PSS competitive and strategic potential, with an in-depth analysis of success elements.}

Traditional authentication schemes must store a form of authentication data on the devices, putting this data at risk. Approaches based on purely public/private key infrastructure come with additional computation and maintenance costs. This work proposes a novel non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZKP) authentication protocol that incorporates the limiting factors in IoT communication devices and sensors. Our protocol considers the inherent network instability and replaces the ZKP NP-hard problem using the Merkle tree structure for the creation of the authentication challenge. A series of simulations evaluate the performance of NIZKP against traditional ZKP approaches based on graph isomorphism. A set of performance metrics has been used, namely the channel rounds for client authentication, effects of the authentication processes, and the protocol interactions to determine areas of improvements. The simulation results indicate empirical evidence for the suitability of our NIKP approach for authentication purposes in resource-constrained IoT environments.}

However, as with all new fields, the scholarly literature is characterized by increased variability and diversity of topics covered, constructs used, and the relationships between them, resulting in an unclear and blurry understanding of the whole of digital transformation. Our article closes this gap by identifying distinctive digital transformation strategies in terms of two critical dimensions: usage of digital technologies and readiness of a business model for digital operation. The result is a typology of four generic digital transformation strategies that essentially differ in the primary motivation and target of transformation, leadership style, importance of skills like creativity and entrepreneurial spirit among employees, risks and challenges faced in the process, consequences of potential failure, and available tactics for improvement. By providing heuristics and a systematic basis for comparison of different strategies, it is our belief that the proposed framework will be useful to researchers and managers responsible for and interested in digital transformation.}

The relevance from a practitioner perspective is straightforward: entire industries have been challenged and disrupted. From a theoretical perspective, the concept is less developed. This research aims to understand it through a Business Model perspective, better highlighting the design variables that may lead to this kind of innovation. Leveraging crisp-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (csQCA) to define the necessary conditions to be called a Big Bang Disruptor, this paper relies on a Rock Clustering method – using the Unicorns' list as the sample - to highlight common patterns. Results show two main factors: the chance to innovate the meaning and to rely on a two-sided market structure as key variables to design a Big Bang Disruptor. Results are discussed under the lenses of previous research. Finally, limitations and avenues for further studies are explored.}

abstract = {The volume and variety of data collected for modern organisations has increased significantly over the last decade necessitating the detection and prevention of disclosure of sensitive data. Data loss prevention is an embedded process used to protect against disclosure of sensitive data to external uncontrolled environments. A typical Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system uses custom policies to identify and prevent accidental and malicious data leakage producing large number of security alerts including significant volume of false positives. Consequently, identifying legitimate data loss can be very challenging as each incident comprises of different characteristics often requiring extensive intervention by a domain expert to review alerts individually. This limits the ability to detect data loss alerts in real-time making organisations vulnerable to financial and reputational damages. The aim of this research is to strengthen data loss detection capabilities of a DLP system by implementing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of legitimate data loss. We conducted extensive experimentation using Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms with historical email incident data collected by a globally established telecommunication enterprise. The final model produced with Random Forest algorithm was identified as the most effective as it was successfully able to predict approximately 95% data loss incidents accurately with an average true positive value of 90%. Furthermore, the proposed solution successfully enables identification of legitimate data loss in email DLP whilst facilitating prioritisation of real data loss through human-understandable explanation of the decision thereby improving the efficiency of the process.}

abstract = {There is focus among most leading academic institutions globally to understand digital transformation. While most operate on some common premise related with the construct of digital transformation there is no established definition yet. Existing descriptions cover a wide range of things from smart living, future of work, automation, industry convergence, and technology among others. These are sometimes fairly all encompassing, inconsistent and incomparable as a point of reference. Interestingly, major consulting firms, technology promoters, independent influencers, analysts promote transformation solutions, each with their own models, interpretation and descriptions. In the paper, we develop an understanding on what is the nature of demand for digital transformation. This is based on evidences of narratives from large financial institutions. We scoped our study on four large banks in North America to see — is there an essence of transformation when institutions adopt digital technology? The paper deals on key themes — drivers, benefits, perception of digital transformation, readiness of banks and deployment instances. Understanding how large financial institutions are adopting digital technologies is important for contemporary technology providers, institutions, researchers and analysts. The study conducted is qualitative along with associated quantitative techniques and visual analytics. This is achieved by theme-based narrative analysis of the public disclosures from four large North American Banks across five years (FY’13–FY’17). The research analyzes the relevant narratives from annual reports to code them into logical themes thereby providing a view of the key focus and associations. Analyzing the practices and manifestations of the institutions this research classifies standard and more advanced differentiating practices. This leads to an emergent structure for a Digital Transformation Maturity Model (DTMM). The authors believe these will serve as indicative maturity guidance for digital technology adoption by financial institutions, in similar context and will also be beneficial to technology providers.}

We try to draw a holistic view of how Taiwan youngsters use their smartphones and how their parents mediate that use by surveying all possible factors related to that use. According to the analytical results, we ascertained that smartphone ownership and dissimilar purposes for surfing the Internet are associated with students' SAT. Online games and trade are related to younger students' SAT, while SNSs is associated with older students' SAT. Additionally, teenagers' cybersecurity knowledge regarding smartphones is negatively related to their SAT. Lastly, we found parent-reported mediation strategies are barely effective, and parents are even unaware of older students’ smartphone use. The implications for suitable interventions in family and school contexts are discussed followed by the analyses.}

The purpose of this paper is to understand future inquiries for scholars to broaden their perspectives and leveraging knowledge management to enhance the supply chain digitisation research paradigm. This is done through both a large-scale literature review as well as a textual analysis and forecasting on industry- and field-applications, technologies and topics in digitisation.

Applying the field of knowledge management to supply chain management through a knowledge management theoretical framework, this paper provides future research inquiries pertaining to how scholars can utilize the largely ignored areas of supply chain digitisation as well as the growing areas to explain how the human dimension of supply chain management can be further explored for the purposes of optimizing supply chain digital performance.}

This paper presents a case study of a smart farming innovation originating from a small-to-medium sized enterprise (SME) that designs and manufactures machinery used in broadacre, conservation tillage farming. The innovation, known as DOT™, is an entrepreneur’s response to problems in the agriculture industry. Applying the innovation opportunity space (IOS) conceptual framework, this study identified the process of innovation was based on synthesis of tacit knowledge (experience-based knowledge of farming and agribusiness) and codified knowledge (drawing on computer programming). The innovation offers a solution for farming problems, and other firms are incorporating the autonomous functionality into their short-line manufacturing operations through licensing agreements, and early farmer adoption is positive. However, this smart farming IOS is presently an Unstable IOS and there remain some gaps: public policy for safe deployment of autonomous agriculture vehicles is lagging behind the invention and commercialization; the new business models for manufacture and commercialization of high-tech equipment are just emerging, and data ownership and control remain unresolved; and evidence of the value of smart farming technologies to farmers and the larger social system and biosphere remains scant.}

abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the most rampant attacks in the modern Internet of Things (IoT) network infrastructures. Security plays a very vital role for an ever-growing heterogeneous network of IoT nodes, which are directly connected to each other. Due to the preliminary stage of Software Defined Networking (SDN), in the IoT network, sampling based measurement approaches currently results in low-accuracy, higher memory consumption, higher-overhead in processing and network, and low attack-detection. To deal with these aforementioned issues, this paper proposes sFlow and adaptive polling based sampling with Snort Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and deep learning based model, which helps to lower down the various types of prevalent DDoS attacks inside the IoT network. The flexible decoupling property of SDN enables us to program network devices for required parameters without utilizing third-party propriety based hardware or software. Firstly, in data-plane, to lower down processing and network overhead of switches, we deployed sFlow and adaptive polling based sampling individually. Secondly, in control-plane, to optimize detection accuracy, we deployed Snort IDS collaboratively with Stacked Autoencoders (SAE) deep learning model. Furthermore, after applying performance metrics on collected traffic streams, we quantitatively investigate trade off among attack detection accuracy and resources overhead. The evaluation of the proposed system demonstrates higher detection accuracy with 95% of True Positive rate with less than 4% of False Positive rate within sFlow based implementation compared to adaptive polling.}

Unfortunately, medical-grade video recording equipment is often costly. Various novel methods of video recording that utilize commercially available products offer adequate alternatives. Certain ethical and legal issues also need to be considered before the commencement of video recording in the operating room to protect both the patient and surgeon. We review the current applications and methods of video recording in ophthalmic surgery described in the literature, as well as the potential ethical and legal issues surrounding video recording.}

However, digital technologies involve significant changes, sometimes breaking with what constitutes known commodities in healthcare organizations and systems (e.g., data governance, inter-operability, security and safety, literacy and training). The recent cyberattacks that have affected and disrupted many healthcare organizations and systems around the world are one of the illustrations.

This study partially plugs this knowledge gap and, by reviewing examples of existing applications of BCT in various economic sectors and across different consumption markets, evaluates its potential for future integration into hospitality operations management. The framework of prospective use of BCT in the hospitality industry alongside the related organisational, institutional and technological challenges that need to be overcome for its wider industrial adoption are outlined.}

This article contrasts the public values created by digital platforms in cities with the democratic and social national values that the platform society is leaving behind. It innovates by showing how co-regulation can balance public values with platform values. In this article, we argue that despite the value-creation benefits produced by the digital platforms under analysis, public authorities should be aware of the risks of technocratic discourses and potential conflicts between platform and local values. In this context, we suggest a normative framework which enhances the need for a new kind of knowledge-service creation in the form of local public-interest technology. Moreover, our framework proposes a negotiated contractual system that seeks to balance platform values with public values in an attempt to address the digital enforcement problem driven by the functional sovereignty role of platforms.}

We detail the historical development of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in each location, with a particular focus on the institutions and support structures that link and sustain key resources that are central to technology clusters. We operationalize key segments of the Technopolis wheel including (1) networks and connectedness, (2) investment capital, and (3) innovation and R&D. The empirical analysis specifies models testing for location-specific variation in the influence of these factors on entrepreneur location choice. We supplement this with analysis of interview data from 45 technology entrepreneurs with direct experience in these locations. We find that higher degrees of connectedness in Austin and Silicon Valley are an important factor in retaining potential entrepreneurs and several institutions were linked to facilitating tie formation and accessing key resources within the Technopolis. We also find that the frequency of funding opportunities positively influences entrepreneurs moving to Austin, Boston, and Silicon Valley to immediately start a company. In Boston, we find a positive association between patents and staying in Boston to launch a startup and we find that older entrepreneurs living in New York and Silicon Valley are less likely to remain and start a company.}

Using a sample of 7109 Korean adolescents (female 52.9%; age range 13–17) from the Korean Institute of Criminology (2014), this study used Latent Class Analysis to identify subgroups that exhibit similar (i.e., class homogeneity) and dissimilar (i.e., class separation) patterns of bullying victimization across subgroups. The findings revealed that adolescents who engaged in risky online leisure activities, online lifestyle activities, and online risky social networking activities were more likely to be victimized by cyberbullying than those who engaged less frequently in the aforementioned behaviors. In addition, adolescents who more frequently engaged in online lifestyle activities and online risky social networking activities were at higher risk of being victimized by cyberbullying compared to traditional bullying.}

We provide a framework for digital activism by extending Milbrath's (1965) hierarchy of political participation that divides activism into spectator, transitional, and gladiatorial activities. Using this framework, we identify ten activities of digital activism that are represented in the literature. These include digital spectator activities: clicktivism, metavoicing, assertion; digital transitional activities: e-funding, political consumerism, digital petitions, and botivism; and digital gladiatorial activities: data activism, exposure, and hacktivism. Last, we analyze the activities in terms of participants, SMOs, individuals who are targeted by the activity, and organizations that are targeted by the activity. We highlight four major implications and offer four meta-conjectures on the mechanisms of digital activism and their resulting impacts, and reveal a new construct where participants digitally organize yet lack an identifying cause, which we label connective emotion.}

It finds that in this latecomer case, the aims and the organization of collaboration differ markedly from the standard assumptions regarding university-industry collaboration with established firms: Huawei's collaborative R&D projects are aimed at fast and unidirectional technology absorption, involve a high degree of control and do not seek long-term personal interaction. The manifestation of these characteristics, however, changes over time. With these findings, this paper adds a new perspective to the literature on university-industry collaboration and to the literature on latecomer firms' knowledge-seeking behavior.}

Nevertheless, geographers do not simply consider cybersecurity as a mode of security imposed “online” or through digital technologies.

Streaming data is often prone to evolution over time. In this context, the main challenge for computational models is to adapt to changes, known as concept drifts, using data mining and optimisation techniques. We present a novel ensemble technique called RED-PSO that seamlessly adapts to different concept drifts in non-stationary data stream classification tasks. RED-PSO is based on a three-layer architecture to produce classification types of different size, each created by randomly selecting a certain percentage of features from a pool of features of the target data stream. An evolutionary algorithm, namely, Replicator Dynamics (RD), is used to seamlessly adapt to different concept drifts; it allows good performing types to grow and poor performing ones to shrink in size. In addition, the selected feature combinations in all classification types are optimised using a non-canonical version of the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) technique for each layer individually. PSO allows the types in each layer to go towards local (within the same type) and global (in all types) optimums with a specified velocity. A set of experiments are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed method to state-of-the-art algorithms using real-world and synthetic data streams in immediate and delayed prequential evaluation settings. The results show a favourable performance of our method in different environments.}

abstract = {Recently, with the development of “Industry 4.0”, “Oil and Gas 4.0” has also been put on the agenda in the past two years. Some companies and experts believe that “Oil and Gas 4.0” can completely change the status quo of the oil and gas industry, which can bring huge benefits because it accelerates the digitization and intelligentization of the oil and gas industry. However, the “Oil and Gas 4.0” is still in its infancy. Therefore, this paper systematically introduces the concept and core technologies of “Oil and Gas 4.0”, such as big data and the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Moreover, this paper analyzes typical application scenarios of the oil and gas industry chain (upstream, midstream and downstream) through examples, such as intelligent oilfield, intelligent pipeline, and intelligent refinery. It is concluded that the essence of “Oil and Gas 4.0” is a data-driven intelligence system based on the highly digitization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first academic peer-reviewed paper on the “Oil and Gas 4.0” era, aiming to let more oil and gas industry personnel understand its benefits and application scenarios, so as to better apply it to practical engineering in the future.

It then introduces the digital valuation model which includes four methods: (1) intrinsic, (2) extrinsic, (3) subjective, and (4) opportunity value. Using this model, the digital economy is measured in three ways: (1) value created from the digitization of traditional industries; (2) value created from digital-native industries; and (3) value created from having the digital option, that is, the “invisible” digital economy measured by opportunity value of the digital option. The digital theory of value is introduced in this chapter with its six laws: (1) law of machine time, (2) law of recombination, (3) law of hyperconnectivity, (4) law of subjectivity, (5) law of abundance, and (6) law of new division of labor.}

Tourists below 30 years engaged in digital chatting, digital gaming and social networking. Also, married tourists as well as those who travelled alone engaged in digital chatting. Leisure tourists engaged in social networking likewise tourists from Europe and North America. The tourists registered three main concerns on digital leisure: cost, poor digital infrastructure and safety concern. These concerns varied based on sex, continent of origin, purpose of visit and trip organisation. The implications of these findings for destination management, digital product development and management are discussed.}

Such initiatives are often associated with promises of transformational government, which is more efficient and utilizes modern technology to increase democratic engagement. However, research shows that several e-Government initiatives fail to deliver the promised benefits and attract a large portion of citizens. Some researchers argue that many initiatives have been driven by technology rather than by the core values of government, which has resulted in weakened democracy. Against this backdrop, the purpose of this paper is to achieve a greater understanding of risk in the e-Government field. Through a literature study, research papers were analyzed and divided into categories based on their unit of analysis, and ontological and epistemological properties. Four themes were identified in the material: IT security, user adoption, implementation barriers, and policy and democracy. This paper concludes by suggesting these themes would provide a suitable point of departure for a risk management framework in e-Government. Thus, future research should explore ways to converge these different strands of literature in multi-disciplinary research.}

Key principles of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology were followed for conducting systematic reviews. Following a research path, we present the values, challenges and future directions of the scientific area using indicative examples from relevant published articles. The study reveals that one of the main values created is the development of analytical techniques which provides personalized health services to users and supports human decision-making using automated algorithms, challenging the power issues in the doctor-patient relationship and creating new working conditions. A main challenge to data analytics is data management and security when processing large volumes of sensitive, personal health data. Future research is directed towards the development of systems that will standardize and secure the process of extracting private healthcare datasets from relevant organizations. Our systematic literature review aims to provide to governments and health policy-makers a better understanding of how the development of a data driven strategy can improve public health and the functioning of healthcare organizations but also how can create challenges that need to be addressed in the near future to avoid societal malfunctions.}

Conversely, the literature on cloud computing rarely addresses human–machine interactions, which raise distinctive ethical and legal concerns. In this paper, we investigate, from a European legal and regulatory perspective, the growing interdependence and interactions of tangible and virtual elements in cloud robotics environments. We highlight specific problems and challenges in regulating such complex and dynamic ecosystems and explore potential solutions. To illustrate practical challenges, we consider several examples of cloud robotics ecosystems involving multiple parties, various physical devices, and various cloud services. These examples illuminate the complexity of interactions between relevant parties. By identifying pressing legal and regulatory issues in relation to cloud robotics, we hope to inform the policy debate and set the scene for further research.}

Awareness of the need to address food defence is gaining pace in the food industry. Indeed implementing an effective food defence strategy is a key pre-requisite to comply with third party certification standards. There is however a knowledge gap with regard to the types of threat that fall within the scope of a food defence strategy and also how these issues can then be mitigated and where possible eliminated.
Scope and approach
This research seeks to position food defence as a supply chain risk mitigation strategy and use case studies of real-world issues to frame the taxonomy of food defence threats.
Key findings
In order to differentiate food defence threats (food attack) from wider food crime, the research postulates that food defence strategies needs to address intentional adulteration to gain personal attention, to gain financial reward through extortion or to gain attention for a particular cause or ideology i.e. food terrorism. More covert threats include sabotage, espionage, intellectual property theft, and cybercrime, including hacktivism. These threats can cause actual harm to individuals, members of certain populations and communities or to organisations. This can lead to large scale, economic, political or social unrest and disruption of the supply chain and thus fit within the scope of food defence activities. To inform food defence risk assessment and management processes, this taxonomy needs to be developed and accepted across the food industry so that threats can be consistently and effectively addressed and as a result consumers, industry partners, shareholders and also the organisation itself can be protected.}

Even now, despite technological advancements, many systems that have been retrofitted for compatibility with the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) remain unprotected. In a world of connected devices, industries vulnerable to attack must upgrade their security systems. The Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming an increasingly popular route taken by malicious hackers looking to gain access to organisations' networks. Part of the problem is that network capability is often bolted onto the existing systems. And IT and operational technology (OT) teams lack co-ordination when it comes to security.

To this end, the objective of this research is to explore the DM concept to inform firms about the dynamically changing manufacturing environment, along with the emerging opportunities, and support business stakeholders in implementing DM-oriented strategies to achieve digitalisation, personalisation, and localisation. More specifically, the present research builds upon the Dynamic Capability Theory (DCT) and conducts semi-structured interviews with a panel of 16 experts from the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods, Automotive, and Engineering industries to develop 12 exploratory industry cases. Our analysis highlights three strategies that companies can adopt to implement DM and realise shorter lead times and personalised product offerings, namely: (i) small-scale DM; (ii) in-house decoupled manufacturing; and (iii) outsourced decoupled manufacturing. However, the economic viability of the DM concept is identified as a significant barrier to relinquish the traditional centralised economies-of-scale. This research contributes by applying the DCT to the DM concept to advocate the viability and sustainability of manufacturing systems in the era of Industry 4.0. Pertaining to the originality of this research, limited work is available on the applicability of DM in industries, from the DCT perspective, to accomplish competitive advantages in the dynamic environment of manufacturing.}

A transparent real-time market for road use is essential for MaaS to reach its full potential. We focus on how network-wide, real-time markets for road use support MaaS, and how such markets can be developed. In our proposed network-management scheme, roadway tolls (for entire trips – from origin to destination) are determined in a two-stage market hosted by an independent system operator or “ISO”. Service providers purchase the product (the right to use a series of road segments at a reasonably specific time of day) in the day-ahead market. In real-time, the market becomes physical and operates under the principle of open access: road capacity cannot be withheld in real time and its use is determined by users’ decisions, guided by prices and suggested routings. Real-time road-use prices are computed using clearing prices that balance real-time supply and demand. Those with pre-paid slots can be paid to delay their travel, to create space for high bidders during periods of suddenly low capacity or unexpectedly high demand. Such policies and programs can avoid excessive congestion, provide reliable travel times, and keep traffic moving, especially as automation makes car and truck travel easier. Such policies are critical in helping cities and regions avoid gridlock. They ensure that travelers internalize congestion externalities, while enabling MaaS and other transport providers to deliver higher-quality mobility service for all travelers. Thoughtful marriage of week-ahead, day-ahead and real-time road pricing for travelers on congested networks can deliver efficient transportation systems that save time and energy, while providing signals for optimal infrastructure investment.}

abstract = {Under pressures to reach net zero emissions by 2050, there is an ongoing transition of energy decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization. Physical and information flows in energy systems are increasingly complex and distributed, leaving centralized structures inefficient. Blockchain technology is suggested as part of the next step in this transition. Blockchain has potential to facilitate distributed, peer-to-peer trading with reduced transaction costs, increased security via cryptography, and prosumer choice. However, there are as of yet multiple challenges to the expansion of blockchain in the energy sector. This paper argues that analysis of these challenges requires a multi-angled approach incorporating technological, economic, social, environmental, and institutional dimensions. First, each dimension is explored, substantiated based on a blockchain-based energy system case in Japan. Concrete challenges of scaling this case toward 2050 and potential opportunities in overcoming these challenges are discussed, leveraging extensive literature review. Finally, an overview of strategic indications is suggested. The findings of this paper present initial indications on challenges and opportunities to overcome them based on a multi-dimensional overview. It is suggested that the factors identified across the dimensions are interrelated. This would in turn call for coherent innovation management and multi-stakeholder innovation ecosystems. Living Labs and regulatory sandboxes are prospective foundations to support such ecosystems, and enable informed decision-making among both private and public sector actors. At large, it is suggested that a holistic and pragmatic approach can benefit the application and scalability of blockchain in the energy transition.}

A 3-phase-process is developed where first literature is reviewed and based on common criteria development cases from 80 cities are gathered. The 2nd phase builds up a technology inventory for the selected cases. The 3rd phase is the expert prediction phase for technology maturity, in which technology development predictions are used to establish the causal relationship between a technology and the timing of its application. This process produces a technology roadmap which is then used as the basis for organizing smart city technologies and applications into four ascending layers: Sensor, Integration, Intelligent, and Application. The result is a blueprint for the application of smart city technologies. In addition, 36 smart city experts were surveyed to assess the maturity of and connection between smart city technologies, markets, and industries. Current smart city developments can then be ascertained to provide recommendations on smart city development. This preliminary forecast and analysis of smart city technologies can be applied to related industries to gain a general understanding of trends in the development of key technologies and applications.}

This study investigated the views of healthcare professionals (HCPs) as end-users of mobile technologies to inform the requirements for a successful move towards a mobile first culture of work within secondary care. Many HCPs already used mobile devices to support their day-to-day practice and so transitioning to an organisational led mobile way of working is both needed and timely.
Materials and methods
In-depth focus groups and interviews at a UK academic hospital were conducted with HCPs (nurses, doctors, and allied health professionals). The interviews elicited views from HCPs about the use of mobile technologies in their clinical work and discussed their experiences of previous technology deployments.
Results
Thirty-four HCPs participated. Three themes were identified: integrating mobile working in hospital care; addressing data governance and accountability for mobile working; and handling the pace of change. The acceptance of mobile working is determined by whether it enhances, rather than hinders clinical practice whilst holding end-user’s confidence; measuring the impact of the administrative burden on workload, changes to professional accountability and safeguarding patient data are serious issues that need consideration; and the pace of change needs to work for all stakeholders.
Discussion and conclusions
The benefits of adopting mobile technologies are well recognised, however, technical and policy related factors identified by professional end-users require answers in order to successfully integrate mobile working into current practice. Adopting a mobile first approach to work is timely and achievable, but can only be delivered on a foundation of positive end-user engagement and strong organisational leadership.}

In response, cybersecurity exercises, and in particular—cyber defence exercises (CDX) are becoming ever more popular. They provide a training platform to simulate real-life situations. CDX are significant events involving months of preparation, and previous studies show a lack of objective evidence of their relevance regarding the learning impact. Skills of exercise participants are usually different and vary from tech-savvy to beginners. Also, trainees are diverse when considering their background, current work profile (position and institution), and experience. Assessment of their competencies is essential to ensure quality in training. The complexity and multi-dimensionality of the usual CDX make it challenging. Additionally, the costly event usually focuses on just a subset of participants, and non-technical members of an organisation are not included. The goal of our research is to provide a proper methodology to optimise the exercises so that every team and each participant, including a non-technical trainee, are adequately evaluated and trained using the allocated resources most effectively. This paper presents a framework to aid in the development and assessment of cybersecurity competences of all teams during hybrid CDX. The framework aims towards raised cybersecurity awareness—a state when every user of digital technologies understands the associated risks. The framework consists of a sequence of steps including stages of formative assessment, team construction, determination of objectives for different types of teams, and the exercise flow. It complements standard methodologies for cybersecurity training programs. The framework was developed based on data collected using questionnaires, interviews, and direct observation in a case study carried out during international cybersecurity exercises. The framework would help organise hybrid exercises for a diverse community of trainees, including non-technical members of an organisation.}

Digitalization is frequently addressed in recent economic and social scientific literature. This paper applies a distinction to digital data (raw data) and digital technologies (including both software platforms and hardware solutions). The open data is defined as follows: it is publicly available and non-chargeable data (information content) that is machine readable. Open data enables software and application development for external partners and users. A common feature in open-data applications is location-based identification (e.g., real-time traffic monitoring). These include spatial map visualizations, and monitoring of traffic and modes of transport. This visualized information provides additional support for data-based decision-making and management as these study results indicate. This information is valuable particularly in the decisions concerning unconventional and sudden events. This research indicates that the most suitable data resources for opening include information related to port transport infrastructure. In terms of temporal monitoring, static road and rail data is currently the most potential alternative for open data in ports. The main reasons are that these data sources are already at least partly published. However, they are not always in open-data formats. Static data is also a grounded starting point because the technical requirements are much less demanding in comparison to real-time data-processing and management}

Most of the exchanged data between the Internet of Things (IoT) devices are not adequately secured due to resource constraints on IoT devices. Attribute Based SignCryption (ABSC) is a powerful cryptographic mechanism suitable for distributed environments, providing flexible access control and data secrecy. However, it imposes high designcryption costs, and does not support access policy update (user addition/revocation). This paper presents PROUD, an ABSC solution, to securely outsource data designcryption process to edge servers in order to reduce the computation overhead on the user side. PROUD allows end-users to offload most of the designcryption overhead to an edge server and verify the correctness of the received partially designcrypted data from the edge server. Moreover, PROUD provides the access policy update feature with neither involving a proxy-server, nor re-signcrypting the signcrypted message and re-distributing the users’ secret keys. The access policy update feature in PROUD does not affect the size of the message received by the end-user which reduces the bandwidth and the storage usage. Our comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis prove that PROUD outperforms existing schemes in terms of functionality, communication and computation overhead.}

The moving patients suffering from the same disease or living in the neighborhood of the same healthcare provider constitute a delay tolerant network (DTN) to help each other forwarding the patient health information (PHI). Unfortunately, the mobile device carried on each patient collecting PHI from body sensors is subjected to sophisticated attacks. To reduce the probability of patients being threatened by a newly identified target node compromise attack, maximize the credits earned from transmitting packets and achieve the fairness among patients, a game theory based secure incentive mechanism GTSIM is proposed. Based on it, by exploiting the complete marriage theory in combinatorics, a patient-optimized privacy-preserving packet forwarding scheme POP is devised to protect the PHI confidentiality and the identity/location privacy of the patients, decrease the privacy exposure when intermediate patients are compromised and realize the property of patient-optimization required in m-healthcare systems. Last but not least, the security analysis shows both our proposed GTSIM and POP can resist various sophisticated attacks and the extensive simulation demonstrates the practicability and efficiency with high message delivery ratio, obtainable utility fraction and low average latency.}

China has become the world's second largest R&D spender and it is fast climbing the global value chains. However, not without costly efforts and resounding failures. In a process of perpetual experimentation, China's policymaking is changing fast as it trial-tests new policies. Based on the analysis of policy documents at national and sub-national levels, as well as on an array of interviews with industry stakeholders, this study finds that the principal paradigm change is the fact that the state increasingly aims to become a platform creator, facilitator and strategy-setter for innovation, rather than a principal actor itself. The government plays a multitude of roles that differ significantly across industries and levels of administration, in a way that could be best described as structured uncertainty. While in some industries, the state follows the classical approach of central-led investments and heavy protectionism, in others, it acts more as a business-partner and multiplier for private investment. There are also those industries where the government stimulates emerging technology by completely refraining from any action or regulation.}

abstract = {Background
The complicated nature of cloud computing encompassing internet-based technologies and service models for delivering IT applications, processing capability, storage, and memory space brings along challenging problems. Some issues such as information security, privacy, and legal aspects of cloud computing may become challenging while cross passing with another complex domain like healthcare.
Objectives
The present study was conducted to report the results of a systematic literature review on the legal aspects of health cloud.
Method
The original English papers published in Pub Med, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Digital Library databases were extracted, among which1582 were related to the legal aspects of health cloud environment and were selected using predefined search strings.
Conclusion
Through the review process, effective factors in relation to a health cloud legal framework were identified and accordingly, a proper design was developed for this domain. Next, the identified factors were confirmed and adjusted by mapping the contents of the selected papers to different categories and subcategories under the proposed framework. Five Main categories like the issues related to the compliance, data protection, Identity Credential Access Management (ICAM), ownership, and quality of service were selected as the basic pillars in the proposed framework. Finally, 22 papers were selected, among which 19 were mapped to the compliance issues, 18 the issues related to “Data protection” were addressed, and 14 “Identity Credential Access Management (ICAM)” was discussed. Fifteen Papers were mapped to “Data ownership” and “Quality of service” categories. Some papers were found to present some solutions in all the mentioned areas; however, most of them have addressed only a few issues.}

abstract = {The “industry 4.0" phenomenon is expected to influence almost every aspect of business value chains, and hence it has been increasingly analyzed by management scholars. However, the overarching intellectual structure emerging from this new stream of literature has not yet been synthesized in a framework nor critically discussed. Furthermore, despite being part of the rhetoric in several recent industrial governmental plans, industry 4.0 in service sectors has not been systematically reviewed to date. By leveraging a systematic quantitative literature review, a data-driven approach and a quantitative methodology—embedding both bibliographic coupling and network analysis techniques—this study provides a clear visualization of the emerging intellectual structure of industry 4.0 in management studies. We also develop a framework based on the most recurrent themes emerging from the results of bibliometric and network analyses—the latter could be used by management scholars to understand studies surrounding industry 4.0. As service businesses can create and capture value generated through the 4th Industrial Revolution as well as manufacturing firms, we suggest that scholarly attention should also be directed toward the service industries and provide a research agenda.}

To date, no comprehensive study has focused on developing a proper understanding of the concept of ‘data property rights’, and hence we lack the solid theoretical support needed to construct a proper protective system for such rights. This paper offers the first systematic study of the rules pertaining to data property rights, thereby enriching the theory of such rights and serving as a theoretical basis for the enactment of a civil code that protects citizens’ legal rights and interests in the information society. It also offers a thorough discussion of how to construct a data property protection system, thereby providing an ideal reference model for enactment of the Chinese Civil Code.}

Everyday physical items such as lights, locks and industrial machineries can now be part of the IoT ecosystem. IoT has redefined the management of critical and non-critical systems with the aim of making our lives more safe, efficient and comfortable. As a result, IoT technology is having a huge positive impact on our lives. However, in addition to these positives, IoT systems have also attracted negative attention from malicious users who aim to infiltrate weaknesses within IoT systems for their own gain, referred to as cyber security attacks. By creating an introduction to IoT, this paper seeks to highlight IoT cyber security vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques to the reader. The paper is suitable for developers, practitioners, and academics, particularly from fields such as computer networking, information or communication technology or electronics. The paper begins by introducing IoT as the culmination of two hundred years of evolution within communication technologies. Around 2014, IoT reached consumers, early products were mostly small closed IoT networks, followed by large networks such as smart cities, and continuing to evolve into Next Generation Internet; internet systems which incorporate human values. Following this evolutionary introduction, IoT architectures are compared and some of the technologies that are part of each architectural layer are introduced. Security threats within each architectural layer and some mitigation strategies are discussed, finally, the paper concludes with some future developments.}

By leveraging these benefits, automation is brought about in the industries giving rise to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). IoT is prone to several cyberattacks and needs challenging approaches to achieve the desired security. Moreover, with the emergence of IIoT, the security vulnerabilities posed by it are even more devastating. Therefore, in order to provide a guideline to researchers, this survey primarily attempts to classify the attacks based on the objects of vulnerability. Subsequently, each of the individual attacks is mapped to one or more layers of the generalized IoT/IIoT architecture followed by a discussion on the countermeasures proposed in literature. Some relevant real-life attacks for each of these categories are also discussed. We further discuss the countermeasures proposed for the most relevant security threats in IIoT. A case study on two of the most important industrial IoT applications is also highlighted. Next, we explore the challenges brought by the centralized IoT/IIoT architecture and how blockchain can effectively be used towards addressing such challenges. In this context, we also discuss in detail one IoT specific Blockchain design known as Tangle, its merits and demerits. We further highlight the most relevant Blockchain-based solutions provided in recent times to counter the challenges posed by the traditional cloud-centered applications. The blockchain-related solutions provided in the context of two of the most relevant applications for each of IoT and IIoT is also discussed. Subsequently, we design a taxonomy of the security research areas in IoT/IIoT along with their corresponding solutions. Finally, several open research directions relevant to the focus of this survey are identified.}

Radio propagation and mobility are particular in this context, as they are influenced by the characteristics and movement of the human body and by the necessity to keep the transmission power at its minimum to save energy and limit interactions with the wearer. In this paper, we investigate the broadcasting problem in which a node, typically the gateway, tries to send a packet to all other nodes in the network at minimal cost. This problem is not as trivial as it looks and we show through simulation that forwarding strategies coming from the Delay Tolerant Networks world cannot be transposed without adaptation. We enriched the Omnet++ simulator with a WBAN-specific channel model from the literature, and use this model to evaluate 9 classes of broadcasting algorithms, including our own proposals, with respect to their ability to cover the whole network, their completion delay, their cost in terms of transmissions volume and their capability to preserve multiple packets order (i.e. total order broadcast). Our study shows that there is a subtle compromise to find between verbose strategies that achieve good performance at the cost of numerous transmissions, ultimately provoking collisions and more cautious solutions that miss transmission opportunities because of mobility.}

A qualitative approach was conducted by interviewing auditors from the five largest auditing firms in France. This paper demonstrates that digital technology is impacting at five key levels audit firms especially the audit role as a governance mechanism. Digitalization will improve the audit relevance (1) allowing audit firms to extend their offers by proposing new services (2). It will also improve the audit quality mainly by analysing all data’s customer (3). Finally, with the digitalization a new auditor profile emerges (4), enabling the culture of innovation within audit firms (5). Thus, the firm governance will be improved but the managers ‘discretionary power will be limited. This research highlights the importance of implementing digital strategies to provide regulators with the necessary modifications that need to occur for audit standards. It should enable Business School and universities to adapt their training programs according to the audit firms’ expectations.}

However, we tend to make mistakes in our understanding of those around us and the situations that we encounter. We do so because our cognitive resources have limits, meaning that we have developed systems of coming to quick conclusions based on limited information. These processes are known as heuristics. This is not a flaw; rather it is an adaptive strategy that allows us to navigate and survive in our social worlds. Nevertheless, these tendencies may lead people to engage in cybersecurity in risky ways, either as the instigators of attacks, the targets of attacks, or the cybersecurity professionals who seek to prevent and mitigate attacks. Examples of this include group dynamics in which individuals overestimate the abilities of their own group whilst underestimating the abilities of competing groups, or failing to recognize the threat of cybersecurity risks that are difficult to visualize. In ways like those used with marketing and advertising campaigns, social engineers aim to exploit these quirks of social influence and human decision making. A greater understanding of these processes will enable us to develop more informed prevention and mitigation strategies in order to address the increasing challenges we face within cybersecurity.}

Successful information security practice depends on tactics and strategies that situate the need for protection within organisational goals. These tactics and strategies have become progressively important as organisations are disrupted by digital technology. The locus of control is unpredictably distributed across groups within an organisation. Finding consensus about the need for security thus becomes challenging. Information security controls are an important part of the control structure but increasingly they are negotiated controls, making the process of securing as important as the security mechanisms themselves. We employ broader political and social theories of security, most notably Smith (2005), to analyse data from nine semi-structured interviews of Australian information security practitioners. Our findings delineate the interlinking concepts of securing and security. Security is straightforward. It is a state of being secure. Securing, on the other hand, is complex. It is a consensus-seeking, value-engagement process that enables the attainment of security. Through this analysis, we identify processes and techniques of securing tacitly employed by the participants. Central to effective securing practice is a participant's ability to, ‘get the security message right.’ The message is used to create an agreed value consensus across conflict-ridden environments. We contend that securing is often undervalued and not recognised as a distinct theoretical part of the discipline of information security. However, given the complexity and uncertainty of information security practice, we argue that securing needs to be considered as a critical component of being secure.}

Australian agriculture and the attitudes of Australian farmers to the adoption and uptake of smart farming technologies is used to highlight the tensions., however the issues and challenges raised are common to many agricultural industries throughout the world. We combine insights from a survey of Australian farmers with a legal analysis of the way in which agricultural data are collected, controlled, shared and used. We argue that the lack of transparency and clarity around issues such as data ownership, portability, privacy, trust and liability in the commercial relationships governing smart farming are contributing to farmers’ reluctance to engage in the widespread sharing of their farm data that smart farming facilitates. At the heart of the concerns is the lack of trust between the farmers as data contributors, and those third parties who collect, aggregate and share their data. The aim of this paper is to examine the issues giving rise to this lack of trust. We conclude with recommendations on how to address these concerns and facilitate the improved adoption of smart farming technologies, focusing on the need for the social architecture of the agricultural data relationships to change. To achieve this change, open dialogue, education and awareness raising and good data governance are essential to help build trust in the adoption of smart farming systems.}

We bring together several strands in the literature to model the strategies of the firm, which has suffered a cyber breach and theft of trade secrets, and the government security agency, which must investigate and prosecute crimes. We investigate the interactions between these two players, in which the firm has private information about its cybersecurity investment. This investment level is unknown to the security agency, which must nonetheless decide how to prioritize reported crime. We model this asymmetric information problem within a game theoretic signaling framework derived from Becker's work in crime and punishment. We suggest that such a framework can inform policy to encourage security investments by firms and more efficient resource utilization by security agencies. We particularly focus on an illustrative stylized example to highlight how our modelling approach can be helpful. In this example we compare two worlds; one where all security breaches become public knowledge and another where only reported breaches become public knowledge. We then formulate two potentially testable Hypotheses and several implications of these Hypotheses. Case studies and a policy analysis further highlight how our framework plays out in reality.}

However, the emergency of bias injection attack aiming at destroying the energy management center, brings great security threat to the security of smart energy grid. To address risks in energy-cyber-physical systems, this paper proposes a distributed detection and isolation scheme against the bias injection attack in smart energy grid. Considering the transmitted information of energy management centers in adjacent grid subareas, the proposed distributed detection and isolation scheme includes local and global steps. In the local-step, each local energy management center detects and isolates the possible sensor attack set, based on the constructed local attack signature judgment logic matrix. In the global-step, the subarea attack set is detected and isolated via the established global attack signature judgment logic matrix. Combining the above local and global detection and isolation framework, we can ensure the security of energy management center in smart energy system. This proposed distributed detection and isolation scheme examines some important practical aspects of deploying bias injection attack detection including: the limitation of the precomputed threshold; the detection delay; the accuracy in detecting bias injection attack. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed distributed detection and isolation scheme is demonstrated by using detailed studies on the IEEE 8-bus and IEEE 118-bus smart energy grid system.}

Diverging conceptualizations of the subject matter has been offered as one driving factor behind the difficulty to cooperate at the international level. This paper contends that while international cooperation in cybersecurity has been difficult because of diverging definitions and conceptualizations of the subject, which are apparent in the international system, the problem grew into a state of gridlock because this divergence is anchored in the incompatibility of the ways in which major cyber powers organize their respective political systems at home. As such, it is argued that, the role of the multilateral system to bring about any significant progress in cybersecurity governance is very limited.}

At Agbogbloshie, despite the intentions of national Ghanaian regulations and hazardous waste laws, most e-waste is untreated or crudely processed via burning or acid baths. These practices release dioxins, furans, and heavy metals into the environment, invariably harming scrapyard workers, their families, and the greater urban community of Accra. However, the scrapyard also provides a critical source of livelihood for some of Ghana’s most poor, vulnerable, and unskilled migrants. The aim and objective of this study is to humanize the conundrums and challenges that e-waste invokes in places such as Ghana. Based on extensive and original field research—including expert interviews, community interviews with scrapyard workers and families, and naturalistic observation at waste sites and other parts of the e-waste supply chain—this study asks: What benefits has e-waste brought communities in Ghana? What risks has it created? And, critically, what policies need implemented to make e-waste more sustainable? It documents ten ostensible benefits of e-waste alongside ten very real and growing risks. Then, it identifies a concert of fifteen different policy recommendations as well as four research gaps. It concludes by emphasizing the duality of the e-waste phenomenon and e-waste policy, and by underscoring the political economy dynamics of e-waste activities and practices.}

While this produces many opportunities for increased efficiency, it introduces a new level of complexity for securing and reliably operating reactors in the presence cyber-threats. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission recently began urging stronger cybersecurity efforts at nuclear power plants. As upgrades at nuclear power plants begin, the implementation of digital instrumentation and control systems to monitor and run the power plant introduces new vulnerabilities that must be addressed. This necessitates a more modern discussion of risk. Within this context, we critically review past cyber-vulnerability incidents at nuclear installations and other critical facilities. We then analyze challenges to vulnerabilities within the context of modernization of the current nuclear fleet and propose future research directions needed to resolve these issues.}

It will look at providing a general understanding of the concept of cyberterrorism in order to assess the threat, impact and causes. This chapter will address the various definitions relating to cyberterrorism in order to break down critical components that may constitute a cyberattack. The severity, target and motivation are just some of the core concepts that critically define cyberterrorism. In this chapter, several queries regarding cyberterrorism are discussed in order to differentiate between cybercrime, hacking and cyberterrorism. Overall, this chapter aims to show the significance of the cyberterrorism threat and its associated ties to cybercrime and terrorism.}

abstract = {This article revisits and updates the definitions of cyberspace and cyberculture put forward by Bell in 2009. Beginning with the earliest mention of cyberspace in Gibson's 1984 novel, the article identifies some of the problems of defining the constantly shifting and fluid space that is cyberspace. Cyberspace is not a single simple space, and cyberculture is not a single homogeneous culture. The cultural practices and social organization within cyberspace are both individual and at the same time global in nature. In fact cyberspace is the ultimate postmodern concept because it is socially determined and constructed by the billions of individuals who go there and are connected to each other. At the same time those billions of individuals are constantly being tracked, measured, classified, and recorded in millions of bytes of metadata. This leads to the creation of an individualized “data body” for each one of us. Constant surveillance and tracking allow a range of both official and unofficial agencies to gain insights into our daily and hourly movements and activities. Cyberspace is everywhere, and approaches to its study are many and varied as the updated list illustrates. The chapter ends by picking out the theme of cyberterrorism to illustrate how investigating routinized social practices in relation to the globally recognized locale of cyberspace play out.}

abstract = {Digital technologies have nowadays a significant impact on how new business ventures are imagined and created. The arising technology paradigm is leveraging the potential of collaboration and collective intelligence to design and launch more robust and sustainable entrepreneurial initiatives. However, although the topic of digital entrepreneurship is relevant and timely, there is a limited literature discussion on the real impact of digital technologies and collaboration on the entrepreneurial process. Further research is needed to describe the nature and characteristics of the entrepreneurial ecosystem enabled by the new socio-technical paradigm. Based on extant literature, this article proposes a definition of digital entrepreneurship ecosystem by highlighting the integrated digital-output and digital-environment perspectives. A collective intelligence approach is then adopted to define a descriptive framework and identify the distinguishing genes of a digital entrepreneurship ecosystem. Four dimensions associated to digital actors (who), digital activities (what), digital motivations (why), and digital organization (how) are defined and discussed. The framework was also applied to describe 9 real cases of companies and initiatives, which are analyzed as digital entrepreneurship ecosystems along the four key dimensions presented. The article ends with a discussion about the results and a research agenda for future studies.}

To synthesise research in this field, this literature review systematically examines papers that have been published in the last thirteen years. The present review aims at expanding our understanding of the sub-topics, perspectives, methodologies, and trends that characterise this nascent field of investigation. Literature gaps are highlighted and an agenda for further work is proposed. First of its kind, this review concludes that information security management in higher education is a highly under-investigated topic. Areas for further research include information security culture; comparative studies on information security management in industries other than higher education; comparative studies across universities; and economics of information security management.}

abstract = {The future of energy is complex, with fluctuating renewable resources in increasingly distributed systems. It is suggested that blockchain technology is a timely innovation with potential to facilitate this future. Peer-to-peer (P2P) microgrids can support renewable energy as well as economically empower consumers and prosumers. However, the rapid development of blockchain and prospects for P2P energy networks is coupled with several grey areas in the institutional landscape. The purpose of this paper is to holistically explore potential challenges of blockchain-based P2P microgrids, and propose practical implications for institutional development as well as academia. An analytical framework for P2P microgrids is developed based on literature review as well as expert interviews. The framework incorporates 1) Technological, 2) Economic, 3) Social, 4) Environmental and 5) Institutional dimensions. Directions for future work in practical and academic contexts are identified. It is suggested that bridging the gap from technological to institutional readiness would require the incorporation of all dimensions as well as their inter-relatedness. Gradual institutional change leveraging community-building and regulatory sandbox approaches are proposed as potential pathways in incorporating this multi-dimensionality, reducing cross-sectoral silos, and facilitating interoperability between current and future systems. By offering insight through holistic conceptualization, this paper aims to contribute to expanding research in building the pillars of a more substantiated institutional arch for blockchain in the energy sector.}

The reader should note that most of these factors—and others discussed in this chapter—apply to nuclear power plants as well as fossil-fired units. There are also many nonpower plants and individual structures that became redundant and were subject to different forms of redevelopment, ranging from mere preservation with a minimum renovation to more drastic changes. At heritage sites, developers strive to preserve the identity and character of the former uses. The economics and stakeholders' interests in industrial reuse and heritage, when supported by adequate location and architectural dimensions, have created many opportunities for adaptive reuse. A wide range of case histories—categorized according to prior use and as redeveloped—are illustrated in this chapter.}

This paper aims to explore how top executives interpret the concept of Industry 4.0, the driving forces for introducing new technologies and the main barriers to Industry 4.0. The authors applied a qualitative case study design involving 26 semi-structured interviews with leading members of firms, including chief digital officers and chief executive officers. Company websites and annual reports were also examined to increase the reliability and validity of the results. The authors found that management desire to increase control and enable real-time performance measurement is a significant driving force behind Industry 4.0, alongside production factors. Organizational resistance at both employee and middle management levels can significantly hinder the introduction of Industry 4.0 technologies, though these technologies can also transform management functions. Multinational enterprises have higher driving forces and lower barriers to industry 4.0 than small and medium-sized companies, but these smaller companies have good opportunities, too.}

Innovations to address these issues include novel technologies (e.g., electric and autonomous vehicles; EVs, AVs), and new business models and social practices (e.g., shared mobility). Yet, far more attention by policy-makers and researchers has been paid to the technical aspects of a low-carbon mobility transition than to social or psychological aspects, or the role of the user. In this paper, we integrate insights from the multi-level perspective on transitions and socio-psychological literature and draw on transport expert interview (N = 11) data, to examine (a) what influences current attitudes and behaviours in respect of EVs and AVs, and shared mobility, and (b) how this may change in the years to come. We argue that technological change may be most compatible with the transport regime (dominated by personal car-based mobility) but potentially affords a narrower range of sustainability benefits, while mobility substitution (e.g., reducing the need to travel through tele-working or -shopping) may be most challenging for both policy-makers and publics, while potentially addressing a wider range of sustainability problems associated with the transport regime. Shared mobility options sit somewhere in between and challenge certain aspects of the regime (e.g., status associated with car ownership) while offering certain environmental, social and economic benefits. For all three areas of innovation, policy interventions need to address the needs, preferences, experiences and identities of users if they are to be effective and sustainable.}

The links between blockchain technology, OM, and sustainability issues within SCM are analysed. This two-step research study includes a broad review of the main contributions in the literature that have focused on blockchain technology and OM in SCM. It covers the airport industry from the perspective of sustainable performance and data analysis by reading and processing financial statements, non-financial reports, and the website of one strategic airport infrastructure in southern Italy. The Italian airport infrastructure investigated successfully adopted the Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) platform. This is one of the main blockchain technology applications in the airport industry. It promotes cooperation between the main players in the aviation industry and the air traffic controllers (ATCs) to reduce fragmentation, inefficiency, and uncoordinated operations. It also allows information and data sharing, but it is still not possible to observe a high level of sustainable performance. Although the adoption of blockchain technology presents numerous benefits, especially in improving OM, these new technological solutions do not guarantee the achievement of the best performance in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability issues. Managers and policy makers need to work together to create a real forum within their collaborative network in which there is a common culture and mutual trust. This article adds an interesting reading of blockchain technology to the existing research with concerns about OM and sustainability issues within the airport setting in Italy.}
