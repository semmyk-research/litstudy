abstract = {Despite the significance of context in international business studies, existing reviews on foreign divestment have combined findings from developed and emerging markets, obscuring context-specific antecedents, decisions, and outcomes. In this review, we systematically identify and synthesize theoretical and empirical research on foreign divestment from emerging markets based on 60 articles in reputed academic journals. We develop a conceptual framework that integrates the antecedents, decisions, moderating mechanisms, and outcomes of foreign divestment in emerging markets. While firm-level antecedents of foreign divestment are well-researched, external antecedents, decisions, moderating mechanisms, and outcomes are understudied. Additionally, we highlight that foreign divestment from emerging markets has positive and negative consequences for the firm and the host country. Drawing insights from our review, we delve into prospective research agendas, forging connections between contemporary research themes, divestment, and emerging markets. We propose that a multi-level approach to studying the antecedents and outcomes of foreign divestment will enhance our understanding of international business dynamics within an increasingly volatile global environment.}

The abundance of information from diverse sources needs to be aggregated to enable robust decision-making strategies. Data fusion is the process of integrating various data from heterogeneous sources to produce more useful, accurate, and reliable information about system behavior. This paper reviews recent developments in data fusion techniques applied to SHM systems. The theoretical concepts, applications, benefits, and limitations of current methods and challenges in SHM are presented, and future trends in data fusion methods are discussed.

The possibility and scale of DCBMAs will increase in countries with developed digital infrastructure, digital market, and digital technology. We extend a new distance dimension and find that digital distance may impede DCBMAs between two countries.

Its pivotal role in managing risky environments by offering preventive and proactive measures cannot be overstated. The research contribution lies in introducing a set of criteria for assessing the adoption of Blockchain technology, specifically designed to evaluate the resilience of the retail sector. This study aims to ensure the establishment of a sustainable, resilient supply chain across diverse retail categories, particularly in the face of uncertain circumstances. A hybrid decision-making approach that combines the Best-Worst Method (BWM) and Fuzzy TODIM has been employed to achieve these objectives. This study encompasses various types of retail companies to assess and compare their resilience levels by adopting Blockchain technology. The results of this study robustly suggest that speciality retailers with well-established, long-term partnerships are more predisposed to embrace and leverage the capabilities of Blockchain technologies. Conversely, discount retailers in Turkey face various challenges that impede their effective integration of Blockchain technologies. These challenges encompass collaborating with suppliers on short-term agreements and the unavailability of product tracking, among other factors. As a result, the outcomes of this study offer valuable insights for retailers in the sector, suggesting that they should consider modifying their operational strategies to better align with the adoption and integration of Blockchain technologies in the future.}

Traditional real estate investments usually involve third-party intermediaries for verifying and recording informal real estate transactions. This paper proposes a blockchain-based real estate investment model and presents a detailed description of the real estate register authentication aspect of the model. The model uses blockchain technology to create tamper-evident records of real estate transactions and provide secure authentication and verification for informal real estate transactions. Meanwhile, each real estate transaction is recorded in a block, and all transaction records are kept on the blockchain. This means that inventors can access these transaction records and verify their authenticity and validity. The system can also use smart contracts to automate the process of real estate transactions, which further improves transaction efficiency and reduces costs. Furthermore, the model's timestamp and authentication mechanism can eliminate third-party intermediaries and ensure the authenticity and validity of real estate transactions through distributed ledgers and verification mechanisms. Overall, blockchain-based real estate systems offer advantages of security, transparency, efficiency, and cost reduction. With ongoing blockchain advancements, these systems are expected to play a crucial role in future real estate investment transactions.}

Despite the increasing global policy focus on CE, research on the role of digital government in initiating, implementing, and consolidating a transition towards a circular economy is surprisingly scarce and fragmented, and a systematic effort in digital government research is yet to emerge. To tackle this issue, this article sets out to answer the research question: what is the role of digital government in the transition towards a circular economy? Driven by this research question, we conduct a review on 88 empirical studies in the Information Systems (IS) and digital government fields and discuss existing research foci and gaps in relation to the types of digital technologies used, the types of stakeholders involved, the stages of the product life cycle, and the type of resources that governments draw on to advance the circular economy transition. In addition, we identify two types of transition styles, based on an analysis of the types of roles taken by the government in two cases of transition towards a circular economy. Based on these findings, we provide two contributions to establishing a new line of research in digital government and the circular economy: an analytical framework, including a static view, a longitudinal view, and a transition style view of the role of digital government in the circular economy transition; and a research agenda that builds on our framework, to guide future research on the role of digital government in the circular economy transition.}

To achieve this balance, the Smart Grid uses a network of sensors and transmission devices. The smart meter, as the key element of the Smart Grid, is an undisputed promise to optimize energy efficiency, but it raises certain questions in terms of data exploitation and privacy protection. Smart meters (SM) deployed in SG systems collect and transmit data to the service provider. Therefore, trust, security, and confidentiality are required in the SG system. Since communications between entities are exposed to attacks, strong protection is needed. In this article, we perform both trust mutual authentication algorithm and soft data transit for the Smart Grid using rotation function. We prove the security of our algorithm against known attacks. To prevent key escrow problems, keys are smoothly updated. In addition, the efficiency of the algorithm against relevant work is demonstrated using real measurements.}

However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing study investigates the new trends of ransomware tactics and techniques and provides a comprehensive analysis of ransomware attacks and their detection techniques for IIoT systems. Therefore, this paper investigates this attack and its associated detection techniques in IIoT systems in various aspects, including recent ransomware tactics, types, infected operating systems, and platforms. Specifically, we initially discuss the evolution of the IIoT system and its common architecture. Then, we provide an in-depth examination of the development of ransomware attacks and their constituent blocks, outline recent tactics and types of ransomware, and provide an extensive overview of the latest research on detection models. We also summarize numerous significant issues that have yet to be addressed and require further research. We conclude that offensive and defensive research is urgently needed to protect IIoT against ransomware attacks.}

It is also crucial for any country or jurisdiction to have a LAS in order to manage the ownership, their people’s relationship to land, and disasters, improve resilience, support, and achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A successful implementation, however, depends on designing appropriate systems by considering a number of important parameters. Our societies today face many sustainability challenges such as population growth, disaster occurrences, and scarcity of land resources. By considering global initiatives for sustainability and community resilience, current LASs should be assessed to make sure they are efficient in addressing sustainability challenges. Therefore, their design framework and components require ongoing adjustments. In this context, the need for advancing LASs design has become increasingly evident since international institutions and land administration agencies have been pursuing research and development to improve LASs. These authorities have proposed several related frameworks and models, including SDGs, the New Urban Agenda (NUA), the Framework for Effective Land Administration (FELA), and the Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF). In addition, there are several investigations proposing frameworks for the evaluation of LASs. Therefore, this study aims to do a comprehensive investigation of relevant global initiatives and research-driven evaluation frameworks that lay the foundation for advancing parameters in LASs. By implementing the Document Analysis method, this study proposes the required parameters and their indicators that are critically important for advancing LASs.}

This data is processed by Service Providers in order to improve and develop new services and products, but also to fund themselves. However, processing personal data may result in the extraction of sensitive information, which, in turn, may lead to jeopardizing the users’ privacy. To mitigate this significant risk, the European Parliament and Council of the European Union elaborated the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This regulation forces Service Providers to obtain Data Subjects’ explicit consent prior to collecting and processing their personal data. Nevertheless, the GDPR’s legislative text does not define how Service Providers must transparently demonstrate that they already have these consents. Moreover, most individuals do not know the rights they have over their personal data, neither does this regulation provide them with efficient methods to be aware of what third parties are doing with such data. In order to address this situation, we propose a lightweight blockchain-based GDPR-compliant personal data management platform. The new solution provides public access to immutable evidences that reflect the reached agreements between Data Subjects and Service Providers. In this way, Service Providers can effectively demonstrate that they are fulfilling the regulation, and Data Subjects are able to control and manage their personal data according to their legitimate rights. We have implemented the new system, and we have performed a detailed study which includes: GDPR-compliance, provided functionality, security and privacy issues, and the cost in terms of gas and US dollars of the different operations to be run on the blockchain.}

Meanwhile, emerging cyber-to-physical (C2P) risks are introduced due to the vulnerability of ICPSs to cyberattacks. An integrated safety and security risk assessment of chemical facilities equipped with industrial cyber-physical systems becomes challenging, particularly in performing a probabilistic/quantitative risk assessment. Targeting this gap, this study develops a systematic approach to construct accident scenarios concerning both safety hazards and security threats and performs a probabilistic risk assessment of chemical facilities considering the interdependency between safety-associated events and security-associated events. In the proposed approach, bow-tie technique is used to perform a safety risk analysis, and meanwhile, the possible dangerous scenarios caused by physical attacks and C2P attacks are also identified and integrated into the bow-tie diagram. Particularly, attack impact modeling of C2P attacks helps to identify dangerous attack modes, and a time-to-compromise (TTC) based method is used to quantify the vulnerability of ICPSs to C2P attacks. Then, a Bayesian network (BN) model is developed to perform an integrated safety and security risk analysis. An illustrative case study is used in this study to give guidance on performing integrated safety and security risk assessment of ICPSs and validate the feasibility of the proposed approach.}

Therefore, studying the factors that can influence the mineral resources trade is crucial in increasing the pace of global efforts toward energy transition. The conventional environment of natural resource trading is going through substantial changes in an age characterized by quick technology breakthroughs and increased dependence on digital finance systems. In addition, countries' policies and plans are now heavily influenced by the quest for energy security. However, whether digital inclusion and energy security risks have any role in boosting mineral resources trade is an empirical question overlooked by past studies. The current analysis fills the gap by investigating the influence of digital inclusion and energy security risks on mineral resources trade in world-leading mineral trading countries by utilizing 2SLS and GMM methods for the period from 2007 to 2022. The findings indicate that mineral trade is favorably influenced by digital finance and related variables such as ATMs, bank branches, debit cards, and electronic payments. While ICT has beneficial effects on the expansion of trade in mineral resources. Likewise, energy security risks proliferate the trade in mineral resources. Additionally, GDP and foreign direct investment positively contribute to the trade in mineral resources. In contrast, the consumer price index hurts mineral resources trade. Thus, governments can establish a more robust, fair, and ecologically sustainable global natural resources trading landscape by coordinating policies to take advantage of the favorable synergies between digital finance and energy security issues.}

The Ransomware Risk Assessment module based on the threat appraisal component of PMT and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines can help the chief information security officer (CISO) to assess the risk using predictive analytics techniques. The Ransomware Risk Quantification module uses collective risk modeling to compute the severity of a ransomware attack on an organization. The Ransomware Risk Mitigation module helps the CISO to minimize the probability and impact of a ransomware attack on their organization by (i) investing in perimeter security technologies and training to ensure prepare, deter, detect, restrain, recover, and review mitigation strategies, (ii) adopting the National Institue of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework to ensure business resilience, and (iii) mitigating the residual risk by investing in cyber-risk insurance. We validated the proposed method using a qualitative study by interviewing participants form firms affected by ransomware, managed security service providers, security consultants, and cyber-risk insurers.}

Digital etiquette, a core element of digital citizenship, contributes to proper Internet adoption and reduces inappropriate behavior in cyberspace. To protect children and teenagers from harm online, it is essential to familiarize them with digital etiquette literacy and codes of Internet conduct from an early age. Digital citizenship education is relatively rare in Chinese primary schools. Research on student performance in this regard is also lacking. Digital game-based learning (DGBL) has demonstrated potential to enhance students' learning, motivations, and engagement. In this paper, we designed and implemented a digital game-based course intended to foster students' digital etiquette literacy. A quasi-experiment in a primary school in Guangzhou revealed that compared with conventional learning, DGBL improved students’ digital etiquette literacy while positively influencing their learning-related motivations and engagement. This study can serve as a reference for primary or secondary schools interested in teaching digital etiquette to support global digital citizenship education.}

The paper tells the story of FutureNewsCorp – the largest news media company in Europe in the year 2043. The story of FutureNewsCorp is used for a critical analysis of the most recent draft of the AI Act and here, in particular, of the role of standardisation bodies and the division of responsibility between providers of AI systems and their professional users. Using the scenario method, the paper demonstrates that regulations like the planned AI Act can result in a shift of the power to decide what responsible use of AI is - from regulators and editors to technology developers and standardisation bodies - and that in doing so it may contribute to changing the structure and workings of an entire sector.}

abstract = {The regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) has heavily relied on ex post, reactive tools. This approach has proven inadequate, as numerous foreseeable problems arising out of commercial development and applications of AI have harmed vulnerable persons and communities, with few (and sometimes no) opportunities for recourse. Worse problems are highly likely in the future. By requiring quality control measures before AI is deployed, an ex ante approach would often mitigate and sometimes entirely prevent injuries that AI causes or contributes to. Licensing is an important tool of ex ante regulation, and should be applied in many high-risk domains of AI. Indeed, policymakers and even some leading AI developers and vendors are calling for licensure in the area. To substantiate licensing proposals, this article specifies optimal terms of licensure for AI necessary to justify its use. Given both documented and potential harms arising out of high-risk AI systems, licensing agencies should require firms to demonstrate that their AI meets clear requirements for security, non-discrimination, accuracy, appropriateness, and correctability before being deployed. Under this ex ante model of regulation, AI developers would bear the burden of proof to demonstrate that their technology is not discriminatory, not manipulative, not unfair, not inaccurate, and not illegitimate in its lawful bases and purposes. While the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) can provide key benchmarks here for ex post regulation, the proposed AI Act (AIA) offers a first regulatory attempt towards an ex ante licensure regime in high-risk areas, but it should be strengthened through an expansion of its scope and substantive content and through greater transparency of the ex ante justification process.}

However, common definitions and methods for the demarcation and separation of operational information technology can contribute to coherence in the historically grown body of regulation. This paper identifies three different general approaches for the treatment of information technology within the existing body of law: information technology as a means, as a service and as a product. Furthermore, we compile a general definition of information technology, which consists of three logical subentities: components, systems, and services. Additionally, steps for the practical identification of the operational information technology addressed by material law requirements are shown. First, all services that affect an articulated protected good must be identified. Within the identification of the systems used to realize those services, two dimensions must be considered. There is the functional dimension as well as the control and power of the disposal dimension. An identified weakness of the current state of IT security law is a lack of clearly formulated protected goods within the existing regulations, which contributes to the difficulties of addressing information technology in general. Furthermore, this paper discusses which actors are responsible for a demarcated piece of information technology and what responsibilities are assigned to them. This section also elaborates on the difficulty of appropriately addressing commercial and non-commercial actors.}

Similarly, a 1% growth in the urban population may lead to a 0.14% decline in green growth owing to heightened resource demand and emissions. Conversely, a 1% rise in unemployment rates might lead to a 0.29% decrease in green growth. On the other hand, a 1% increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) could correspond to a 0.15% increase in green growth, and a 1% growth in the e-commerce market could result in a 0.54% increase due to improved resource utilization.

abstract = {Purpose
Cyberfraud is a global problem, which has negative impacts on the financial institutions, global economy and the public. The existing policy and regulatory frameworks for mitigating cyberfraud in South African banks are not holistic, thus, the purpose of this study is to develop a holistic policy and regulatory framework that integrates the legal, governance, internal control and supervisory frameworks for cyberfraud mitigation in the South African banking industry.
Method
ology: The study employs a mixed method comprising of both qualitative and quantitative approaches. A structured questionnaire was developed and made available to selected members of staff of the 17 licensed banks in South Africa. These experts deal directly with the banking operations, administration and customers' services. Non-parametric statistical analysis, specifically the Chi-square, Fischer's Exact, Spearman's correlation and cross tabulation statistics, were employed for the statistical analysis of the data gathered from the survey. From the outcome of the survey, a simplified policy and regulatory framework was developed for the mitigation of the effects of cyberfraud in order to enhance the performance of South African banks.
Findings
The outcome of the survey indicated that there is a relationship between the methods of cyberfraud identification and the occurrence of cyberfraud in the South African banking industry. Furthermore, the methods of cyberfraud identification were presumed to be effective based on the evidence presented in this study. Despite this, the effect of cyberfraud perpetration was still found to be detrimental to the South African banks.
Practical implications
This study presents a simplified and executable policy as well as regulatory framework for mitigating cyberfaud in South African banks. The proposed policies and regulations are geared towards improving cyber resilience and minimising the effects of cyberfraud occurrences.
Novelty
Existing works have not sufficiently reported on the integrated policy and regulatory framework for mitigating cyberfraud. Thus, this study developed a simplified integrated policy and regulatory framework for mitigating cyberfraud to enhance the performance of South African banks in the area of cyberfraud mitigation.}

This study developed a decision-making approach to determine the supply and demand priority of SC services using utility and need theories, with Hong Kong as a case study. The results show that smart environment services should be prioritized for all population groups, while the differences in priority among older adults, people with lower digital literacy, and people with lower income were relatively small. On the one hand, the supply of SC services should be prioritized for those that are closely linked to citizens’ daily lives, have a long-term impact on communities, and are targeted to large user groups. On the other hand, priority should be given to those services that meet citizens’ demands for physiological, safety, and self-actualization needs. This study enriches the theoretical framework of people-centric SC research through the innovative integration of Bradley-Terry and rank-ordered logit models for determining the development priority for SC services, which can serve as a practical decision-making tool for policy makers to effectively allocate resources for sustainable SC development.}

While the application of IT governance provides a means for companies to validate IT functionality, oversee IT operations, and mitigate IT-associated risks, there is a paucity of research examining its implications of IT governance on IT controls, particularly within the context of a firm’s Internal Audit Function (IAF). Addressing this gap in the literature, this research delves into the relationship between the characteristics of the IAF and IT governance within the IAF. It further probes the linkage between IT governance associated with the IAF and IT control activities. We analyze survey data from 414 internal auditors across various Taiwanese companies using partial least squares regression. The findings suggest that IT knowledge and internal auditing roles have a significantly positive relationship with the quality of the IAF-IT relationship and IT governance processes. Similarly, IT audit competencies exhibit a significantly positive relationship with IT governance processes. Furthermore, properly structured IT governance processes and a high-quality IAF-IT relationship demonstrate a positive association with the effectiveness of general controls. This research amalgamates and extends prior investigations into IT governance and internal auditing, underlining their critical role in successfully implementing superior IT controls.}

However, because 6G technology has a very wide range of applications as a fundamental technology, 6G service scenario research is also being conducted for each sector. To predict 6G technology use in the future, it is necessary to understand comprehensively the scenarios being studied sporadically by sector. Therefore, we aim to derive major service scenarios by analyzing in-depth public data for 6G service scenarios. We collected research papers, corporate reports, and news articles on 6G service scenarios and performed topic modeling to derive four major domains and 16 application areas. Afterward, the derived service's feasibility and promising scenario were evaluated by utilizing the future-context canvas and business model canvas that analyze the service's value from the user's and supplier's perspectives, respectively. The research results are expected to support technology development and business planning in the field by enhancing understanding of 6G service scenarios.}

Specifically, the objectives of this study are twofold: (1) to assess the suitability of Industry 4.0 technologies for the triple bottom lines at the product level, and (2) to evaluate these technologies based on product sustainability criteria. Therefore, this study develops a novel Fuzzy Ortho-triplet interval-valued approach for securitizing technologies. To conduct a comprehensive evaluation, this study examines the perspectives of professional technologists holding significant positions as internal and external stakeholders in addressing technological matters within various organizations. The survey results revealed the extent to which nine key technologies could contribute to sustainability at the product level. The results showed that augmented VR has significant potential for advancing social sustainability at the manufacturing level. Similarly, big data analysis exhibits promising results for environmentally and economically sustainable practices at the product level. Policymakers interested in knowing about technologies and how they can be used to make sustainable products would benefit from this kind of assessment, which is essential for sustainable development.}

The use of these technologies in a hybrid work environment increases the importance of digital literacy in maintaining communication and social interactions. This paper aims to examine the role of digital literacy (and particularly the technical, cognitive, and socio-emotional dimensions) in the use of collaborative technologies, as well as the effect of the use of these technologies on perceived social proximity in a hybrid work environment. Data were collected from 5141 public service workers in 2023. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling. The technical dimension of digital literacy is associated with the use of collaborative technologies, though the cognitive and socio-emotional dimensions are not. The use of collaborative technologies is associated with perceived social proximity. The study's findings highlight the importance of technical digital literacy, as well as the positive effect of the use of collaborative technologies on perceived social proximity in the hybrid work environment.}

As a result, individuals are using their home computers to perform diverse tasks and to store sensitive data. This paper investigates the relative efficacy of two strategies to protect home computers from security threats: security tools and security activities. For the analysis, we collected data from over 1900 individuals in Spain, following an approach combining self- reported data, via an online survey, with actual data collected directly from home users' computers. The main contribution of the paper is to provide a model, based on routine activity theory, explaining the role of security tools and security activities in protecting personal computers from malware infection, thus offering an in-depth understanding of users' security behavior. Using multivariate, logit and probit regressions, our study reveals that having security tools is positively related with higher risk activities and more infections, while pursuing security activities reduces malware infections. These results have important implications for policy makers and organizations, reinforcing the view that security tools are not sufficient to protect users from malware infection, and the need to develop security education and awareness programs for computer users.}

We propose an interpretive framework for understanding selection biases in crowdsourced big data applied to tourism research. Inspired by medical terminology, the framework was structured according to external manifestations, internal causes, and potential influencing factors. Using illustrative case data from six websites, the framework demonstrates the emergence and impact of selection biases. Specifically, crowdsourcing-based tourism analysis can be notably affected by online platforms and destination contexts. Crowdsourced samples may not provide a perfect representation of actual travelers due to skewness in gender, age, origin, etc. Tourism researchers and stakeholders are urged to acknowledge selection biases and respond judiciously in their academic and practical efforts. Our research addresses a timely data science issue and offers insights for advancing knowledge innovation and technological improvements in tourism.}

To achieve the goals, this study employs machine learning (ML) techniques to construct a decision support system that predicts different types of juvenile offenses (i.e., non-offense, hacking only, traditional offense only, and both offenses) by risk factors rooted in a variety of criminological theories. This study is based on the data from the Second International Self-Report of Delinquency Study. The results demonstrate the generalizability of mainstream criminological theories to juvenile hacking and dual offenses involving both traditional offense and hacking. ML predictive models can successfully distinguish between different types of juvenile offenders and identify the most influential risk factors (e.g., gender, digital piracy, substance use, victimization, and parental supervision). The relative importance of risk factors provides valuable information to decision-makers and stakeholders in the juvenile justice system for developing more effective risk assessments and early intervention programs targeting different types of juvenile offenders.}

abstract = {Industrial firms are increasingly seeking new means of competitiveness through digital servitization that involves incorporating digital services and platforms. Despite the growing prominence of digital servitization, we have yet to understand how such changes are being framed, reframed, and unfold in industrial firms. To this end, we undertake an in-depth longitudinal exploratory case study of an industrial firm to understand the organizational framing and reframing activities vis-à-vis digital servitization. Our findings identify how motivational, diagnostic, and prognostic framing gradually unfolds over distinct phases. Specifically, our findings reveal the occurrence of frame incongruence among different groups of actors, compelling the firm to engage in strategies and tactics to achieve frame alignment. Notably, we identify that management engages in the alignment processes of frame extension, translation, and clarification, which creates a space of workable certainty. While transient in nature, this state of workable certainty serves as a catalyst in propelling the firm forward in its pursuit of a digital servitization strategy. By shedding light on the process of digital reframing that firms undertake in order to materialize their digital servitization strategy, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of this phenomenon. Moreover, we raise pertinent managerial implications for firms embarking on the path of digital servitization, emphasizing the imperative of continuous attention to the ongoing framing and reframing processes accompanying such change endeavors.}

With contemporary business models hinging on highly performant information systems, there is increased awareness among entrepreneurs that security incidents often have devastating consequences on undertakings’ revenue streams, intellectual property, and brand reputation. As a result, there is an increased focus on the obligation to implement cybersecurity measures. In the context of the GDPR, cybersecurity obligations seem to converge on the requirement to deploy ‘appropriate technical and organisational measures’ in order to ensure a level of security commensurate with the risks posed to an organisation. Yet, given the complex and rapidly evolving nature of the subject matter, the precise meaning and scope of these obligations remain unclear. This contribution offers guidance on how to assess the concept of ‘appropriate technical and organisational measures’ by considering it through the lens of cybersecurity maturity models. Accordingly, this article provides anchorage to scholarly audiences when scrutinizing the extent to which privacy and security measures qualify as ‘appropriate’ in the context of liability claims and actions for damages, thereby creating an opportunity to move from technical insight to legal compliance.}

The intense technological competition between China and the U.S. has exposed the non-neutrality of technology, resulting in geopolitical tensions and strategic market exclusions. The impact of technology on global politics extends beyond a single sector, affecting policies, laws, governance, security, international relations, economics, and human rights. This intersection of technology and global politics forms the basis of GTP, where political decisions and actions are influenced by technological advancements, and vice versa. Understanding the landscape of GTP is therefore crucial for individuals, organizations, and states to navigate the challenges and opportunities of the digital age while ensuring technology serves the public interest. The present study seeks to deepen our understanding of GTP and its implications by reviewing the extant IS research and providing opportunities for future research.}

abstract = {City governments prioritize mobility in urban planning and policy. Greater mobility in a city leads to happier citizens. Although enhanced urban mobility is helpful, it comes with costs, notably in terms of climate change. Transportation systems that enable urban mobility often emit greenhouse gases. Cities must prioritize digital carbon footprint awareness. Cities may reduce the environmental impact of urban mobility while keeping its benefits by close monitoring and reducing the carbon footprint of digital technologies like transportation applications, ride-sharing platforms, and smart traffic control systems. The aim is to advantage prioritize three alternatives, namely doing nothing, upgrading and optimizing data centers and networks, and using renewable energy sources for data centers and networks to minimize the digital carbon footprint using the proposed decision making tool. This study consists of two stages. In the first stage, fuzzy Aczel-Alsina functions (fuzzy Aczel-Alsina weighted assessment — ALWAS method) based Ordinal Priority Approach (OPA) is proposed to find the weights of criteria. Secondly, fuzzy ALWAS Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) model is improved to evaluate and choose the best alternative among the three alternatives. The improved ALWAS-CoCoSo model enables flexible nonlinear processing of uncertain information and simulation of different risk levels. Besides, we proposed the improved fuzzy OPA algorithm for processing uncertain and incomplete information. The case study is provided to the decision-makers to advantage prioritize the alternatives based on twelve criteria organized into four aspects, including digital carbon footprint, externalities, technical capability, and economics. The ranking results reveal that A3=2.445 is the best among the three alternative, while A1=1.705 is the worst alternative. The results show that the best way to reduce the digital carbon footprint is to use renewable energy sources to power data centers and networks (A3).}

They are expected to reduce costs and increase flexibility in operation of nuclear reactors when coupled with intermittent renewable energy sources, while also producing various commodities such as hydrogen or potable water. Adaptive solutions must be considered for each geographical area and based on the involved components of the energy system, available infrastructure, and policy in place. This paper provides an in-depth look at the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of such systems, while addressing different aspects related to the creation of the business case for such systems including decentralization and digitalization of future energy systems. The regulatory aspects are the ones that impose challenges on the emerging hybrid energy systems and this paper highlights some of the considerations that are needed for the couplings involved, in terms of licensing procedures and safety analysis. The potential contribution of such integrated energy systems towards achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) are also discussed. Concerning the stakeholders, special attention should be paid to building social acceptance and trust as this lays the foundation for successful implementation of such projects. By focusing on areas such as research and development, integration of technologies, policy support, market development, grid integration, energy storage, efficiency improvement, system modelling and simulations, significant advances in integrated/hybrid energy systems deployment can be achieved.}

This study delves into how corporate governance and its various dimensions influence carbon neutrality within organizations, with a specific focus on the Iron-Ore sector in China – a notable contributor to carbon emissions in the context of digital economic growth. The research also investigates the role of policy robustness in enhancing carbon neutrality, both as a direct influence and as a potential moderator in the relationship between corporate governance and carbon neutrality. Utilizing a panel data methodology, the study analyzes data from 103 organizations across a three-year span, from 2017 to 2019. The findings, derived from stepwise regression analysis, underscore the importance of factors such as environmental disclosure, policy robustness, the presence of institutional investors, corporate governance practices, and organizational size in steering towards carbon neutrality. These insights are crucial in understanding the intricate interplay between these variables and carbon neutrality in the Iron Ore sector, particularly under the umbrella of the expanding digital economy. The study concludes that organizations can significantly enhance their carbon neutrality – thereby positioning themselves as frontrunners in sustainable practices – through improved environmental disclosure, strengthened policy robustness, and a focus on robust corporate governance. This, in turn, contributes to global efforts in mitigating climate change, an imperative in the rapidly evolving digital economic landscape.}

On the one hand, Fintech advancements are poised to enhance the accessibility of financial services; on the other, it can lead to alterations in market structure. Thus, it is important to ascertain the impact of Fintech entry from both perspectives. We examine the impact of Fintech entry on financial inclusion (FI) and banking competition by introducing conditionalities and non-linearity to uncover the potential transmission channels for Fintech to affect inclusion and market structure. Findings suggest episodes of low and medium inclusion from 2005 till 2018. However, post 2018, there has been a significant increase in FI. Similarly, persistent monopolistic tendencies were observed with most banks enjoying higher Lerner margins. The extent of Fintech reveals highly sluggish growth over 2005 to 2015. However, post 2016, drastic increase is observed commensurate with the central bank's regulatory push. Further, Fintech is inversely related to banks' market power indicating a diminishing effect. We propose three transmission mechanisms for Fintech effects: the inclusion channel, the growth channel, and the regulatory environment. In addition, we find a significant and positive impact of Fintech on FI however, the relationship is essentially non-linear.}

To develop this research question, we carry out an empirical study, with a survey of 3184 manufacturing SMEs, using the “Flash Eurobarometer No. 486” database from Eurostat (European Union). Using machine-learning methodology (ML), our contribution extends previous literature on the barriers to the digital transformation of SMEs, showing the role that IT security issues play in this process. Firstly, our findings indicate a positive association between IT security issues and the process of digitalisation within companies. These IT security challenges are perceived as catalysts for digital transformation, particularly in the context of SMEs. Secondly, our research reveals a significant degree of heterogeneity in the levels of digitalisation across companies. This spectrum ranges from firms at the forefront of digital technology integration, incorporating advanced elements like robotics, cloud computing, and smart devices, to another group of companies in the early stages of adopting Industry 4.0 technologies. Lastly, our study underscores the existence of a parallel relationship between IT security issues and the extent of digitalisation within SMEs. This connection highlights the intricate interplay between cybersecurity concerns and the level of digital maturity achieved by these businesses.}

abstract = {Maritime cyber security is a growing concern in the shipping industry as reliance on technology increases. With the potential for cyber attacks to disrupt vessel operations, compromise sensitive information, and endanger crew and cargo, assessing the risks and developing effective risk management strategies is crucial. On the other hand, cyber risk assessments in maritime transportation have been limited, and there is a lack of probabilistic databases of cyber threats. To remedy this gap, this paper presents a probabilistic approach to estimate cyber threats, especially for the bridge navigational systems in the maritime sector, focusing on the Bayesian network model to evaluate cyber risks for integrated bridge navigational systems onboard, and marine security experts evaluate 32 threats with respect to FMECA (Failure modes, Effect and Criticality Analysis) parameters. Dempster-Shafer theory is utilised to consolidate expert opinions for cyber risk analysis. The findings of the research showed that AIS spoofing poses the highest risk. GPS jamming is the other significant threat to ship bridge navigational systems during cyber attacks. The research provides a basis for identifying cyber threats and risks, calculating the highest risk values and developing control actions to maintain effective risk management strategies for safe and secure maritime transportation.}

Nevertheless, it is still in a nascent stage enduring uncertainties due to the lack of clear guidance about holistic digitalization contributions to the carbon neutrality process (CNP). Moreover, the intricate environmental effects provided by digitalization and digital mechanisms towards CNP present a fragmented landscape with controversial arguments, deserving further exploration. Addressing this gap, multidimensional macro environmental and economic impacts induced by digitalization - such as direct and indirect effects, rebound effects, spillover effects and higher-order effects - are systematically evaluated to answer the issues about whether digitalization can contribute to carbon neutrality. Furthermore, the synergetic management of digital application and carbon reduction are closely related to the energy value chain. To this end, by overviewing objective and comprehensive scenarios related to state-of-the-art digital technologies in multiple sectors of the energy value chain, this study proposes an integral mechanism framework by theorizing an undefined field about digitalization towards CNP in terms of sectoral innovation, energy systems, individual behaviours, carbon-related assurance, and energy security guarantees. Accordingly, this study also contributes to potential directions and rising policy expectations about further estimation of digital effects, broader digital scenarios towards CNP and sustainable digitalization.}

For immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), dosage optimization involves reducing duration of treatment, extending interval administration, and a ‘stop and go’ approach where treatment is resumed if patients progress. Such initiatives will be necessary to optimize effectiveness and achieve the economic savings needed for global access to these drugs. Strategies are needed to increase patient diversity so that clinical trials start to represent the patient groups the interventions being studied intend to treat.

It is also a case of cyber-physical systems with tight couplings between digital changes which might be incited from virtually anywhere, and real-world, physical consequences. The exploration is aimed at understanding, based on interviews, to which extent the existing cyber security practices in the industry carries the potential to be strengthened by the application of resilience principles. An enhanced level of cyber security, denoted cyber resilience, is regarded as a crucial part for the industry to become able to close a strategic agility gap, in which they are at risk of falling behind in their response repertoire, becoming stuck and stale while trying keep up with an increasing rate of shocks through classical modelling and simulation. Resilience is, however, a concept with many meanings, originating from a diversity of academic discourses. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of analyzing the empirical data through an analytical framework of cyber resilience, a “resilience ABC”, accommodating a crucial distinction between robustness and resilience founded on adaptive capacities. Moreover, we find that closing the strategic agility gap requires a cyber resilience approach that is a mix of robustness and adaptive capacity, and that the gradual shift towards more emphasis on adaptive capacity requires a fundamental shift from seeing resilience-as-outcome as just an epiphenomenon of existing practice. In contrast, we see adaptive capacity as resilience-as-process, a phenomenon to study on its own terms. This also implies that cyber resilience management must move beyond a sheer assimilation with risk management. As access to real incident data may be limited, we also advocate the idea of training on scenarios at the boundaries of robustness.}

Non-biodegradable food packaging (mainly plastic) and food waste are two major concerns that cause severe environmental and economic challenges as well as potential human health and food insecurity risks. Therefore, intensive efforts are being devoted to transforming food production and consumption patterns and developing alternative technological solutions to alleviate such issues.
Scope and approach
This review intends to discuss the interplay between food packaging, food waste, and sustainability. Some common strategies used in food packaging are briefly summarised. The significance of nanobiotechnology, smart sensors, and other fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) innovations is emphasized, focusing of the role of these smart technologies in the emergence of novel prospects, such as the development of active and intelligent packaging systems. In addition, insights on consumer acceptance of novel packaging materials/technologies are given and conclusions are drawn. Key findings and conclusions: Several innovative food packaging solutions based on Industry 4.0 technologies are being developed, changing the way food is packed and consumed. Indeed, growing evidence shows that digital technologies (particularly artificial intelligence, big data, blockchain, and 3D printing) will have a greater impact on food packaging in the sense of “Packaging 4.0”. However, more research is still needed to fully harness the benefit of advanced technologies, enabling them to overcome current barriers and achieve a healthier and more sustainable food future.}

Users are expected to adopt secure behavior to avoid those attackers. This secure behavior requires cognitive processing and is often seen as a nuisance which could explain why attacks exploiting user behavior continues to be a fruitful approach for attackers. While adopting secure behavior can be difficult for any user, it can be even more difficult for users with cognitive disabilities. This research focuses on users with cognitive disabilities with the intent of developing design principles for the development of cognitively accessible cybersecurity training. The target group is estimated to include almost 10 % of all users but is previously understudied. The results show that the target group experience cybersecurity as cognitively demanding, sometimes to a degree that becomes incapacitating. Participating in cybersecurity training requires cognitive energy which is a finite resource. Cognitively accessible cybersecurity training requires a minimalist design approach and inclusion of accessibility functions. A minimalist design approach, in this case, means that both informative and design elements should be kept to a minimum. The rationale is that all such elements require cognitive processing which should be kept to a minimum.}

Thematic analysis produces five primary themes (UTAUT2 variables; risk; trust; quality; and other), branching into 24 sub-themes. The weight analysis emphasises the best well-utilised predictors like performance expectancy, trust, security, perceived usefulness, and attitude. In addition, the review identifies research gaps and offers recommendations for future studies using the TCCM (Theory, Context, Constructs, and Method) framework.

Industry 4.0 transforms production equipment into IoTs, which in turn transmit production-related data or their operational status to other connected devices or servers for rapid storage or processing. The results of the processing are used in real-time for the control and supervision of the production system. With the time constraints related to the availability of the processing results, companies have more and more computing servers. These IoT application computing servers are the fog. While processing IoT application data, fog servers require cloud intervention to offload tasks to free them up and provide data storage. Edge computing joins the game when connected objects are themselves computing resources. One of the main challenges of these technologies is the scheduling of dependent/independent tasks. Scheduling IoT workflows in the fog to optimize quality of service (QoS) metrics often requires offloading some tasks to the cloud in order to meet customer satisfaction and service level agreement (SLA) constraints. Therefore, many algorithms have been developed to schedule workflows in the cloud-fog environment. To organize this research, we present a literature review on scheduling workflows in cloud, fog, and edge environments. We outline a taxonomy that systematically classifies existing approaches. Finally, we identify challenges for future work.}

Yet we have little understanding of the process of how and why initially positive design intentions of AI tools result in negative consequences. Building on a qualitative in-depth case study of a Chinese firm introducing an AI tool in sales, we found that whereas the AI tool's initial design seemingly intended to lead to salespeople's empowerment and first achieved respective outcomes, over time the tool was appropriated for managerial control. We show that this devolution emerged organically from a growing managerial awareness of the affordances that the AI tool offered managers to perform their work better.

abstract = {Integrating advanced digital technologies into healthcare systems, known as the Medical 4.0 paradigm, has brought about a revolutionary transformation in the medical field. Thus, to incorporate these advanced technologies systematically and effectively into the healthcare sector, it is imperative to prioritise key enabling factors. This strategic approach streamlines resource allocation, risk management, and the achievement of significant outcomes. In this context, ten crucial enablers play pivotal roles: Policy Support, enhanced diagnostics and treatment, patient-centric care, telehealth and Telemedicine, Internet of Things devices, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, genomics and precision medicine, Cybersecurity, and industry collaboration. This paper introduces and delves into the primary technologies driving this transformative process. The importance of these critical enablers in driving success is assessed using the fuzzy TOPSIS and fuzzy MARCOS methods, which established a quantitative framework for decision-making and prioritisation within the Medical 4.0 landscape. A comprehensive set of evaluation criteria is proposed, encompassing cost-effectiveness, adaptability, risk mitigation, Data Privacy, interoperability, ease of implementation, stakeholder acceptance, environmental impact, supplier and partner compatibility, and regulatory compliance. This research enhances our comprehension of the dynamics propelling the implementation of Medical 4.0, providing valuable insights to unlock the potential of technology-driven healthcare advancements. By employing the fuzzy TOPSIS and fuzzy MARCOS methods, a quantifiable model is established to guide decision-making and prioritise efforts within the expansive Medical 4.0 domain. The results are further validated through a sensitivity analysis. This research offers invaluable insights to both industry professionals and researchers looking to harness the possibilities offered by technology-driven advancements in healthcare.}

abstract = {Technological and computer advances have led to a “new era” of Surgery called Digital Surgery. In it, the management of information is the key. The development of Artificial Intelligence requires “Big Data” to create its algorithms. The use of digital technology for the systematic capture of data from the surgical process raises ethical issues of privacy, property, and consent. The use of these out-of-control data creates uncertainty and can be a source of mistrust and refusal by surgeons to allow its use, requiring a framework for the correct management of them. This paper exposes the current situation of Data Governance in Digital Surgery, the challenges posed and the lines of action necessary to resolve the areas of uncertainty that have arisen in the process, in which the surgeon must play a relevant role.
Resumen

For example, FinTech can improve retail banking, crypto-currencies, and encourages unbanked people to be able to access FinTech via online platforms. However, the adoption of FinTech often faces tough barriers in the context of India. Therefore, this study's objective is to identify such key barriers and analyze their interrelationships and cause/effect classification. The identified FinTech adoption barriers have been determined through a systematic literature review, and the key barriers were finalized based on the expert's inputs. After that, the integrated Fuzzy hybrid methodology was used to understand the in-depth relationships among these barriers. This study's findings confirmed that the lack of government regulation in combination with safety and reliability issues are the major challenging barriers. This study should help practitioners, and policymakers involved in the financial infrastructure development field to tackle barriers in an optimized manner for accelerated FinTech adoption. Our primary contribution to the present theory on FinTech is an early effort to interpret a hierarchical structural model of FinTech adoption barriers in India, which should provide a better understanding of how different barriers can interact with one another.}

However, these aspects are critical since the patterns related to early-stage diffusion establish path-dependencies which have implications for the distribution of the technological opportunities and socio-economic returns linked to these technologies. We focus on the case of artificial intelligence (AI) and train a transformer language model to identify firm-level AI adoption using textual data from over 1.1 million websites and constructing a hyperlink network that includes >380,000 firms in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. We use these data to expand and test epidemic models of inter-firm technology diffusion by integrating the concepts of social capital and network embeddedness. We find that AI adoption is related to three epidemic effect mechanisms: 1) Indirect co-location in industrial and regional hot-spots associated to production of AI knowledge; 2) Direct exposure to sources transmitting deep AI knowledge; 3) Relational embeddedness in the AI knowledge network. The pattern of adoption identified is highly clustered and features a rather closed system of AI adopters which is likely to hinder its broader diffusion. This has implications for policy which should facilitate diffusion beyond localized clusters of expertise. Our findings also point to the need to employ a systemic perspective to investigate the relation between AI adoption and firm performance to identify whether appropriation of the benefits of AI depends on network position and social capital.}

This study used a qualitative approach (the Delphi method) to assess the potential relevance of incorporating blockchain into the online gambling business model. Two research questions were formulated: (i) Is blockchain technology applicable to the online gaming industry, and (ii) What are the expected benefits or contributions for players and operators? To address these research questions, eight blockchain and online gambling experts were interviewed. The interviews proceeded in three rounds until a final consensus was reached. The results reveal the main challenges in implementing blockchain technology for online gambling. The primary challenges are regulation, investment, and the embryonic state of technology. Transparency was identified as the main advantage of applying blockchain to the business model of operators. The study also found that managers and other professionals still had some difficulty perceiving the potential of this technology and its attributes, as was observed in other sectors.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has set the way for the continuing digitalization of society in various manners during the past decade. The IoT is a vast network of intelligent devices exchanging data online. The security component of IoT is crucial given its rapid expansion as a new technology paradigm since it may entail safety-critical procedures and the online storage of sensitive data. Unfortunately, security is the primary challenge when adopting Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. As a result, manufacturers’ and academics’ top priority now is improving the security of IoT devices. A substantial body of literature on the subject encompasses several issues and potential remedies. However, most existing research fails to offer a comprehensive perspective on attacks inside the IoT. Hence, this survey aims to establish a structure to guide researchers by categorizing attacks in the taxonomy according to various factors such as attack domains, attack threat type, attack executions, software surfaces, IoT protocols, attacks based on device property, attacks based on adversary location and attacks based on information damage level. This is followed by a comprehensive analysis of the countermeasures offered in academic literature. In this discourse, the countermeasures proposed for the most significant security attacks in the IoT are investigated. Following this, a comprehensive classification system for the various domains of security research in the IoT and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is developed, accompanied by their respective remedies. In conclusion, the study has revealed several open research areas pertinent to the subject matter.}

In this paper, I first set the scene by overviewing the reasons for the non-use of the internet and against its non-use. I then look at the possibilities of protecting individuals from the obligation to use the internet by means of human rights law, either as a new, standalone right or by way of interpretation of suitable existing rights.

The share of digital technology-related value added of three trade paths in service industries is higher than its share in overall industries. In service industries, simple and complex value chains have a higher share of digital technology-related value added than traditional value chains. Digital technology-related value added in China's service industries grows faster than overall industries, and digital technology-related value added in China's service industries trade grows faster than in overall industries trade. The share of digital technology-related value added in trade is higher and grows faster than its in domestic demand.

Sustainable agri-food production technologies have been reliable in mitigating poverty caused by high demands for food. Recently, the applications of agri-food system technologies have been meaningfully changing the worldwide scene due to both external strengths and internal forces. Digital agriculture (DA) is a pioneering technology helping to meet the growing global demand for sustainable food production. Integrating different sub-branches of DA technologies such as artificial intelligence, automation and robotics, sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics into agriculture practices to reduce waste, optimize farming inputs and enhance crop production. This can help shift from tedious operations to continuously automated processes, resulting in increasing agricultural production by enabling the traceability of products and processes. The application of DA provides agri-food producers with accurate and real-time observations regarding different features influencing their productivity, such as plant health, soil quality, weather conditions, and pest and disease pressure. Analyzing the results achieved by DA can help agricultural producers and scholars make better decisions to increase yields, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and manage resources. The core focus of the current work is to clarify the benefits of some sub-branches of DA in increasing agricultural production efficiency, discuss the challenges of practical DA in the field, and highlight the future perspectives of DA. This review paper can open new directions to speed up the DA application on the farm and link traditional agriculture with modern farming technologies.}

By infusing human intellectual activities into both physical and cyberspace, innovative links between humans and machines are established. Despite limitations in transitioning from tangible human presence to the digital realm in cyberspace, extensive efforts are underway to harness emotional, visual, and oral responses, thereby enhancing the reasoning and predictive capabilities of digital twins. These advancements aim to elevate real-time human interactions with physical and virtual systems by integrating intelligent AI algorithms and cognitive computing systems into digital twins. This paper meticulously analyses recent trends in digital twins, tracing their evolution from traditional concepts and applications to a nuanced digital triplet hierarchy that incorporates human intuition, knowledge, and creativity within cyberspace. we delve into the hierarchical framework of the digital triplet, resonating with maturity, domination, and volition levels, enhances cognitive and perceptual capabilities in cyberspace. The study provides a systematic overview of the development of ultra-realistic digital models, incorporating real-time data-driven artefacts that integrate intelligent activities with multidomain, multiphysics, and multiscale simulations. The research scope is focused on augmenting the perceptive and heuristic capabilities of the digital triplet framework by utilizing AI in data analytics, retrieving heterogeneous data from virtual entities using semantic artificial intelligence technologies, and amalgamating AI and machine learning with human insight and perceptual knowledge. The proposed digital triplet hierarchy aims to enhance cyberspace's capacity for learning, cognitive skills, and knowledge transfer. It can be a guideline for the researcher to promote cognitive augmentation of the human brain through brain-machine/computer interface, virtual, augmented, and extended reality, fostering a symbiotic relationship between humans and machines in the industrial metaverse and industry 5.0. The paper discusses future directions for research and the challenges involved in developing intelligent digital twins towards the digital triplet paradigm, aiming to embody intelligent activities and cognitive capabilities within the framework of human–machine symbiosis.}

abstract = {Presently, majority of car-pooling services depend on a central third party which makes these platforms susceptible to data privacy, security concerns, and a single point of failure. Moreover, drivers and passengers are charged with different services fees by the electric mobility service provider. The emergence of emerging technologies such as Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) can foster trust, boost electric car-pooling business models. Hence, DLT is utilized to store electric car-pooling trips, drivers, and passengers’ information to ensure user privacy and maintain security. Similarly, social practice theories such as Community of Practice (CoP) is progressively considered as a significant structure within societies as it aids the development and sharing of resources across groups. But very little attention has been devoted to examined how CoP can be employed to support the design of decentralized on-demand electric car-pooling. Leveraging CoP and DLT, this paper proposes a decentralized community of practice-based model that enables drivers to publish electric car-pooling services and passengers to be matched to a driver without depending on a trusted third party. A systematic literature review was adopted to collect data and a case study of a decentralized on-demand electric car-pooling was presented. Findings from this study highlights conceptualization of CoP for improving decentralized on-demand electric car-pooling and provide insights on efficient decentralized mechanisms for electric car-pooling. Theoretically, this article identifies the current problems, state-of-the-art of decentralized electric car-pooling. For policy implications this study provides guidelines to effectively govern and manage the development of on-demand electric car-pooling for sustainable public transportation.}

The result shows that “absence of urgency for SC digitalization”, lack of proper innovation strategies”, and “Inadequate leadership to lead digital transformation “are the highest-ranked DSC barriers that needs to be overcome on a priority basis, and “determined top management commitment to digitalization to gain a competitive edge”, “planning and coordination for implementing digital technologies in SC”, and “Adequate management of investment for comprehensive digitalized business” are the top-ranked DSC strategies which has to be considered on priority basis by the management to overcome most of the barriers. Accordingly, the management should effectively plan to mitigate the DSC barriers and implement strategies phase-wise for successful DSC implementation. This study will also guide the practitioner to select the optimal strategies within the available resources. Sensitivity analysis has also been done for the obtained results, whose analysis shows that the proposed research model is robust as ranking strategies are relatively sensitive to barrier weights.}

abstract = {Industry 5.0 vision, a step toward the next industrial revolution and enhancement to Industry 4.0, conceives the new goals of resilient, sustainable, and human-centric approaches in diverse emerging applications such as factories-of-the-future and digital society. The vision seeks to leverage human intelligence and creativity in nexus with intelligent, efficient, and reliable cognitive collaborating robots (cobots) to achieve zero waste, zero-defect, and mass customization-based manufacturing solutions. However, it requires merging distinctive cyber–physical worlds through intelligent orchestration of various technological enablers, e.g., cognitive cobots, human-centric artificial intelligence (AI), cyber–physical systems, digital twins, hyperconverged data storage and computing, communication infrastructure, and others. In this regard, the convergence of the emerging computational intelligence (CI) paradigm and softwarized next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs) can fulfill the stringent communication and computation requirements of the technological enablers of the Industry 5.0, which is the aim of this survey. In this article, we address this issue by reviewing and analyzing current emerging concepts and technologies, e.g., CI tools and frameworks, network-in-box architecture, open radio access networks, softwarized service architectures, potential enabling services, and others, elemental and holistic for designing the objectives of CI-NGWNs to fulfill the Industry 5.0 vision requirements. Furthermore, we outline and discuss ongoing initiatives, demos, and frameworks linked to Industry 5.0. Finally, we provide a list of lessons learned from our detailed review, research challenges, and open issues that should be addressed in CI-NGWNs to realize Industry 5.0.}

The findings reveal the heterogeneous patterns of digital trade networks and their governance characteristics. Furthermore, international, regional, and national technical standards are integral to the hierarchical governance of digital trade networks. Digital trade flow diffuses through a digital trade network, wherein technical standards have different levels of compatibility and security, and digital-trading countries make trade-offs. The results highlight that digital-trading countries need to explicitly incorporate the compatibility and security of technical standards into trade agreements, promote the harmonization of digital standards, and advance international cooperation to guarantee the flow of digital trade and reap its benefits.}

Over the last few years, with advancements in ICTs, there has been a rapid change in travel behaviour. However, little is known about how ICTs and other emerging digital technologies are being utilised in transportation-related communication for public, private, and active transportation. To bridge this gap, this study aims to explore academic and grey literature focused on the use of digital technologies in transportation-related communication. The methodological approach employs a systematic literature review, with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) protocol, to identify digital technologies that are found promising among scholars and practitioners for research, testing and deployment. The study analysed 158 publications and identified some common themes of how these digital technologies can be implemented to improve access to transportation communication. The study finds that: (a) The main literature focus is how information is gathered and shared with transportation users; (b) Advances in mobile applications afford real-time route updates, easy navigation of complex routes, and personalised journey planning; (c) Some notable knowledge gaps exist in how these technologies are implemented—including, willingness to use and digital literacy to understand them; (d) Many digital technologies are at the trial or development phases, which have potential to improve how transportation information can be made readily accessible to all users.}

Whether the business model changes and economic development facilitated by digital technologies will enable China to achieve its goal of a low-carbon transition remains to be seen. Based on 269 cities in China from 2006 to 2021, the study used two-way fixed effects and instrumental variables to analyze the role of DT in carbon reduction and its indirect mechanisms. The results indicate that the wide application and deep integration of DT in the physical industry will reduce carbon emissions (CE). The mechanism analysis reveals that DT, with its efficient, integrated, and green characteristics, will help improve energy efficiency and promote green technology innovation, thereby reducing CE. Most importantly, this study innovatively reveals the role of virtual agglomeration in carbon reduction. It uses data factors with production characteristics to shift the supply and demand parties and related enterprises from physical space to cyberspace agglomeration, which plays a significant positive role in the process of reducing CE. DT has a heterogeneous effect on reducing CE, especially in the sample of urban agglomeration and resource-based cities, which is more intense. The central government's policies on digital infrastructure and CE regulation influence the role of digital technologies in reducing CE. The conclusions of this study have implications for relevant market entities and the government to fully utilise DT to accelerate the realisation of green production and cope with climate change.}

abstract = {In this paper, we propose the twisting observer for robustly estimating the states of a second-order uncertain system. It is well-known that the twisting algorithm achieves the second-order sliding mode condition using the sign information of both the plant states. When all the states are not available, the twisting algorithm cannot be extended to the estimation problem directly. Hence, our proposed observer approximates this unknown sign term for the non-measurable state in the twisting observer with a delayed output-based switching function. It is shown that under some suitable gain conditions, the observer can guarantee any arbitrary accuracy of estimation error for some appropriate delay parameter which can be varied online. The advantage of this observer is that one needs to control only the delay parameter to achieve the desired steady-state accuracy, unlike the additional nonlinear functions found in the existing observers. The application of this observer to output feedback stabilization is also discussed. The separation principle for the closed-loop system is shown by designing the gains of controller and observer independently. Finally, we illustrate the design and performance of the proposed state observation scheme through a numerical example.}

The study's outcomes suggest that positive shocks to the digital economy and natural resources contribute to a rise in green growth. In contrast, negative shocks to these factors lead to decreased green growth. Moreover, the study's findings demonstrate that the augmentation of the labour force, the increase in gross fixed capital formation, and the implementation of expansionary exports and import policy are conducive to advancing green growth. Conversely, contractionary export policy, contractionary import policy, and the continued reliance on fossil fuel consumption impede green growth. Policymakers should emphasize labour force and gross fixed capital formation, enact proactive import and export policies, and reduce dependence on fossil fuels and contractionary strategies to promote sustainable green growth in the Asian top 5 knowledge-based Asian economies.}

This notable potential has attracted attention and has resulted in a growing number of studies on blockchain platforms, cloud-based platforms, and other digital technology platforms. However, DIS adoption and execution is a complex process as it depends on various success factors and barriers and affects numerous capabilities and performance outcomes. Moreover, various information systems and management theories can be utilised to underpin these relationships. Our study aims to conduct a systematic literature review that uncovers dynamic capabilities, barriers, enablers and outcomes of DIS with blockchain and cloud-based platforms, illustrates the relationship between them, and discloses methods and theories applied in supply chains. We discuss different use cases of blockchain and cloud-based platforms for DIS in various business functions in supply chains. Particularly, we reveal six DIS-powered capabilities, five performance outcomes improved by the DIS, eight main barriers, and nine enablers of DIS implementation. The lack of theoretical underpinning and causal empirical studies is identified as an important gap in the literature.
