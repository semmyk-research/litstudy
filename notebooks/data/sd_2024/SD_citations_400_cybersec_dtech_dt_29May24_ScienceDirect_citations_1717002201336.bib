On January 9th, The Digital Decade policy program 2030, a monitoring and cooperation mechanism to achieve common targets for Europe’s digital transformation by 2030, entered into force. After approval by the EU Parliament, the regulation will enter into direct force in all member states and will bring obligations for many sectors. A two-year implementation period is envisaged for transition and updates on the future needs of AI. The AI regulation, along with other EU regulations in the digital sector such as Data Governance Law, Digital Services Law, and Digital Markets Law, contributes to digital policy reform of the EU. The regulation is significant as it broadly defines “AI systems” and imposes specific obligations on actors of the AI chain. In addition, the regulation contains provisions to promote development and uptake of AI systems in the EU. Also, the European AI Board is established to supervise and coordinate the use of artificial intelligence systems on the EU level for all internal markets and EU citizens. The regulation will have an outstanding impact on its scope beyond the EU borders. The European principles or norms are enshrined in the acquis communitaire, meaning the EU’s body of law. They include the centrality of peace, liberty, democracy, supranational rule of law, and human rights. These aspects enable the EU to maintain its normative power for the foreseeable future by pioneering regulatory process in high-tech markets as a result of the codification of its norms as binding agreements.}

abstract = {The need for electric energy is steadily increasing as the industrial age progresses. To balance this demand, the smart grid concept was developed to guarantee effective energy distribution with low losses and secured high degree of quality. Numerous decentralized sources of power have come into existence as a result of the increasing number of nations that have supported the concept of power system innovation. The addition of these decentralized sources of power to the grid will result in an unstable operation of the grid and a significant rise in the difficulties of administration. As a result, there is an immediate requirement to bring about the direct transaction of distributed power supply. The backbone of this concept is to create electricity on a small, individual scale and sell it to the grid. By considering the benefits of blockchain technology in promising applications and the various research problems, the overall research work aim is to empirically examine the determinants that might affect blockchain adoption in smart grid. Transactions are carried out with the use of smart contracts, and the network functions as a verifier of the legitimacy of the transactions. The immutability of transactions is ensured by the blockchain, which also guarantees that all exchanges between consumers and generators are ultimately fulfilled. In addition to this, it offers immutability of transaction history, which is helpful for auditing and can also be utilized when resolving disputes regarding transactions. The smart contract technology offered by Ethereum is utilized in this work in order to bring automation and intelligence to the process of calculating the amount of electricity consumed by individual transactions. Following the formation of a blockchain, private chain comes for the deployment of the smart contract into the private blockchain network. Because of the aforementioned benefits of blockchain technology, the storing of data pertaining to power transactions, as well as the transactions themselves, will be more credible and transparent.}

These technologies are evolving continuously and have the potential for groundbreaking discoveries and practical applications. However, the novelty, speed, and drastic changes that are brought about by new technologies also result in several uncertainties about how new products and services may affect people’s personal health, societal norms, and the environment. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies can be problematic because people can fail to use them appropriately. Since people respond to technology socially, trust influences reliance on automation to a great extent. Performance in delivering effective healthcare outcomes using technology depends largely on appropriate levels of trust being established between humans and their automated agents. A better understanding of human-automation trust can have important implications for the design of AI healthcare frameworks and for training individuals for effective and satisfying interaction with such systems. Against the background of the gender digital divide in the access to and use of technology, the rise of AI and ML in the healthcare sector has important implications for women. While AI has the potential to revolutionize diagnostic and assistive care for women, it still must navigate the trust barrier in assuring and securing a widespread usability by women in all age groups. This chapter looks at the human-automation trust in AI-enabled health care for women. It examines the contextual factors favoring and inhibiting trust with a focus on socioeconomic determinants, decision-making power, and risk perceptions towards AI. The study makes several policy recommendations for the calibration of trust in the use of AI in women’s health care.}

Agile work started spreading also to the manufacturing sector, thanks to the adoption of technologies that increasingly allow remote control of production systems. Nevertheless, agile working in the industry, namely Industrial Agile Working (IAW), requires organisational transformations and investments in technological innovations to guarantee its successful implementation. The first objective of this paper is to define the most relevant dimensions that affect the applicability of agile working practices in industrial contexts. The second objective is to develop an Industrial Agile Working Maturity Model (IAWMM) to measure the maturity of a company in adopting IAW practices. Starting from a set of dimensions identified through scientificic literature analysis, the IAWMM was tested by involving several companies in the manufacturing sector. The refined IAWMM was finally applied to a small sample of companies. The results report a good readiness of the companies concerning the knowledge and application of the key enabling technologies but still a low willingness concerning organisational change and flexible workforce management models. However, the IAW appears to be a promising strategy to promote a better workforce wellbeing and companies’ efficiency and resilience.}

The cyber-physical power system (CPPS) merges physical equipment with communications and information technologies. The CPPS, a physical system closely linked to cyber systems (control, computation, and communication functions), permits two-way power and information flows for smart grid technologies. Digital technologies monitor and regulate the electrical grid more effectively and reliably, yet the power grid is exposed to risk from cybersecurity and includes complex cyber-physical interdependency. CPPS challenges need modeling and rigorous analysis of a complex cyber-physical interaction. Traditional modeling, training, and analysis separate physical and cyber domains, which is unsuitable for current CPPS. Thus, an integrated framework was required to analyze the real situation of physical-cyber system unification. This study reviews modeling, simulation, analysis, cyberattacks, and cybersecurity measures for current CPPS. This study reviews realistic power system cyberattack detection and mitigation control techniques. Finally, CPPS research worldwide and a new route for suggestions and investigation directions for CPPS researchers are offered.}

Digital health solutions, particularly those employing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, have demonstrated their potential to enhance, support, and address these challenges. AI technologies can decentralize services, increase existing system capacities, alleviate healthcare strain, prioritize patient triage, predict disease risk and progression, and expedite drug and vaccine discovery. Ultimately, these technologies aim to reduce morbidity and mortality while improving the quality of care and patients' quality of life. Various examples illustrate AI's benefits, from predicting pandemic trends and disease prevention to virtual assistance, early infection diagnosis, COVID-19 treatment prognostication, and remote monitoring systems that alert physicians to patient deterioration. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the significant challenges associated with developing and scaling up these solutions. Factors to consider include data collection and study size, data quality, validation and reproducibility, ethical issues (e.g., data protection, privacy, patient consent, and ethical use), introduction of biases, potential discrimination, barriers to technology implementation, and fostering trust and acceptance among patients and providers. While AI technologies' potential and benefits are undeniable, their implementation and scaling up must be thoughtfully executed. A holistic approach is necessary to ensure these innovative solutions can truly deliver the desired outcomes.}

Motivated by the growing development of theory for smart cities, a review of the research literature pertaining to smart spaces is provided, followed by a review of the research literature for theory and smart environments. A conceptual framework in support of theory for smart spaces is formulated to guide research and practice in smart environments. Using an exploratory case study approach combined with an explanatory correlational design, this work identifies and explores variables of interest for learning more about, and developing an understanding of, smart spaces. This work also seeks to navigate a way of using theory to inform the work of researchers, practitioners, and those concerned with the making and enacting of smart environments. To this end, ambient theory for smart cities is advanced to accommodate smart spaces as a proposed, viable theory, using a number of variables such as connecting and collaborating. While a good correlation among such variables is found, this work also acknowledges limitations, opening the way for opportunities going forward. In conclusion, this work has implications for the mutual enriching of understandings about smart spaces and smart cities in support of dialogue, debate, and interpretation.}

Many techniques and technological advancements in this area have been used to develop frameworks for transforming construction assets into digital building information models that capture the assets' physical properties, possibly in real time, for facility and operations management. Utilizing different technologies, such as 3D laser scanning and unmanned aerial vehicle imaging, these frameworks strive to reduce cost and delivery time through process automation and intelligence. In this chapter, we highlight and analyze these key technologies and describe the techniques and applications enabled by each one. As a case study, we summarize key AI techniques used for object detection and fault identification based on a dataset collected by drones at a site in Qatar. We then propose a new deep learning technique based on convolutional neural networks for fault detection and identification based on digital models and compare its accuracy with the state-of-the-art.

This paper explores how companies can implement the ecological transformation, with a focus on the role of digital technologies and data in enabling the twin transition. This paper proposes an approach to support SMEs in the twin transition through a combination of digital and sustainable business model development. The concept includes an interdisciplinary methodology that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches, focusing on the latter. The suggested method collection includes adaptations of the business model canvas, value proposition analysis, data-driven decision-making, and the integration of environmental and economic considerations using the system of environmental-economic accounting. In particular, approaches to define the quantification of economic as well as ecological value will be key levers for sustainable implementation. By leveraging these approaches, SMEs can navigate the challenges of digital transformation and sustainability and contribute to a more sustainable future.}

However, several types of risks and uncertainties often lead to high failure rates in innovation projects, to the extent that failure is now considered a typical step in an innovation process. If innovation failure was provoking stress in the past, the current socio-economic contexts makes if it something to regularly deal with and learning from. However, there still is a dilemma on whether innovation failure should be considered as an opportunity or a trauma for the firm. Exploring the three steps of an innovation failure, that is identifying, analyzing and experimenting, the present research offers new insights on the nature of innovation failure at an individual and team levels. In particular, via an inductive approach this study provides fours key approaches to understanding innovation failure. First, we have uncovered a wide range of approaches to organizational management and ‘Spaghetti’ organizational models of innovation that perceive failure as an opportunity for the innovation process. Secondly, our study identified what seems to be a widespread perception of innovation failure as a trauma, which encourages the culture of openness to failure and to share knowledge of failing innovations. Such views apply not only at organizational but also at individual and team levels. Third, our results serve to encourage individuals, teams and organizations to find new ways to learn from failures in innovation projects, and to have a less centralized management and control over innovation. Fourth, in our perception of the domain, failure could become the ‘new normal’ and a mean to generate new knowledge. This stimulates new directions in the decision-making process, towards novel pathways to innovation.}

The findings suggest that consumers do not perceive service encounters with virtual agents from a “one size fits all” approach. Consumers perceive different value-in-use perceptions based on the complexity of the usage contexts. Our results suggest that success in advanced virtual agent encounters may require social presence for robust human-AI interaction. Additionally, this study extends the digital servitization and service robot acceptance model (sRAM) literature by evaluating consumer value-in-use perceptions with empirical evidence.}

We analyzed the more common terms currently being used and propose a common nomenclature: investigative forensic genetic genealogy (iFGG). We define iFGG as the use by law enforcement of genetic genealogy combined with traditional genealogy to generate suspect investigational leads from forensic samples in criminal investigations. We describe iFGG as a proper subset of forensic genetic genealogy, that is, FGG as applied by law enforcement to criminal investigations; hence, investigative FGG or iFGG. We delineate its steps, compare and contrast it with other investigative techniques involving genetic evidence, and contextualize its use within criminal investigations. This characterization is a critical input to future studies regarding the legal status of iFGG and its implications on the right to genetic privacy.}

abstract = {The futuristic view of smart mines is the attainment of automated self-governed mines without human intervention throughout the value chain. However, reality entails a hybrid environment where humans and machines must effectively work together, with a bias towards machines highly aiding human capabilities. The minerals industry will require systems, processes and strategies to navigate this hybrid environment and transitional period. In this work, we focus on the role that integrated remote operation centres (IROCs) will play in ensuring that mining companies continue to get value from technological advancements during the transformation period. A review of IROC implementations by leading mining companies revealed that most functions in IROCs are powered by low-level artificial intelligence, in which most capabilities are goal-oriented. In this situation, automated machines and processes are programmed to accomplish specific tasks without a two-way intelligent interaction with humans. An integrated and intelligent remote operation centre can provide additional benefits. We refer to such a facility as I2ROC. I2ROCs offer opportunities beyond the traditional command-and-control capabilities by providing analytical insights and the interaction between people and machines, which contributes to better decision-making, ultimately improving performance measurability. In this paper, several enablers of I2ROCs are identified, as well as drivers that will accelerate I2ROCs' attainment. The human element is critical in achieving the 21st Century mining model. As such, this paper takes a two-dimensional approach focusing on the role of humans and technology in the future mining model. Key factors are explored, such as the required skillset and how these skills can be enhanced. Specifically, we present essential elements defining I2ROCs and the critical requirements for a digitalised workforce fit for operation within I2ROCs. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for multiple stakeholders to collaboratively pursue I2ROCs through effective education, training, and governance, fostering a more sustainable and resilient future.}

Furthermore, the connections between critical infrastructures are interdependent relations, meaning attacks have the potential to propagate and cause a cascading effect between differing infrastructure types and across national borders. This growing digital threat is discussed by means of a focus on different attack types using case study examples. Research demonstrates that legacy systems and weakening segmentation remain vulnerabilities for the adoption of holistic artificial intelligence-driven security solutions.

Industry 4.0 technologies (I4.0Ts), and particularly increased digitisation, has made for the configuration of new business models and the servitisation of the economy in the context of a new paradigm of competition. This digital servitisation is conducive to networking and enhances the role of proximity. Together with other concurrent factors (changes in relative costs, agglomeration economies, the skills and expertise in data management required by I4.0Ts) this is favouring re-shoring. Technology is always present to a greater or lesser degree as an explanatory factor in re-shoring. The increasing cognitive complexity of technical solutions is enhancing proximity constraints. More frequent, more intense contacts are needed between customers and suppliers in a production set-up that is increasingly customised.}

In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies offer powerful capabilities to enhance IoT devices with intelligent services, resulting in the emerging field known as Artificial Internet of Things (AIoT). Operators find themselves at the center of this complexity, tasking with understanding the situation and making effective real-time decisions. Therefore human factors, especially cognitive aspects, become a significant concern. The cognitive aspects of human involvement must be framed together with intelligent artefacts, a systematic approach being necessary within the domain of Joint Cognitive Systems (JCSs). New software development methods, in the form of assistants and wizards, are essential to assist operators in becoming context-aware and reducing their technical workload related to coding or computer-oriented skills. This shift allows them to focus more effectively on the tasks or services at hands. Considering research experiences in the literature regarding the role of human workers in an AIoT environment, this book analyzes the described situation in terms of Human-Centered Cyber-Physical Systems (HCPSs) with the aim of proposing a conceptual framework for these assistance systems at the cognitive level. To validate this proposal in collaborative tasks, several illustrative examples will be presented. This chapter serves as a general introduction, outlining the different topics shaping the basic aspects of the book. Initially, we delve into generic aspects of disruptive technologies within the context of Industry 4.0 or Society 5.0. Following this, we emphasize the significance of the synergy between the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. Moreover, we provide a clear definition of the concept of a cognitive assistant and elucidate its relationship with human–robot teams. Lastly, we offer a detailed overview of the book's objectives and its contents.}

We followed a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies, which begins with an extensive literature review to establish a theoretical foundation & identify key concepts. The qualitative component involves in-depth interviews with experts the responses evaluated through ISM-MICMAC-DEMATEL analysis with Python programming. The findings are three folds; first, we explored the enablers of DT and LSS approaches and provided a comprehensive analysis on literature. Secondly, we prioritized the DT enablers for LSS practitioners by providing prominence casual values. It suggests that, among the identified enablers, real-time simulation was the most significant reason for DT implementation in LSS practices, followed by edge computing and Interoperability Standards. Additionally, results will help policymakers to faster DT implementation, ensuring LSS practices. This study explored the fact of limited attention on DTs-LSS in previous studies.

Additionally, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Deep Learning (DL) method for Anomaly Detection (AD) is presented in this work. To improve AD, the proposed method uses a DL-based detection method, which is used to parse through many collected security events to develop individual event profiles. The paper also investigated how BDA can be used to address Information Security (IS) issues and how existing Big Data technologies can be adapted to improve BDA's security. This study developed a DL-based Security Information System (DL-SIS) using a combination of event identification for data preprocessing and different Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods. The feasibility and impact of implementing a Big Data Analytics (BDA) system for AD are investigated and addressed in this study. From this study, we learn that BDA systems are highly effective in securing Critical Information Setup from several discrete cyberattacks and that they are currently the best method available. By analyzing the False Positive Rate (FPR), the system facilitates quick action by security analysts in response to cyber threats. DL-SIS had the highest AD accuracy of 99.40% but performed poorly in the high-dimensional dataset.}

abstract = {Multiple cleaner strategies are being devised by governments worldwide to incorporate approaches aligning with sustainable development goals (SDGs), placing particular emphasis on the modal shift from unimodal road to intermodal railroad (IRR) freight transportation. This shift is gaining traction due to its documented positive impact on environmental, economic, and social sustainability. However, adopting IRR freight transportation in emerging economies faces hurdles, primarily attributable to inherent modal shift risks (MSRs). Addressing these MSRs requires the implementation of modal shift solutions (MSSs). This study aims to prioritize the MSSs to mitigate the impact of MSRs in IRR adoption, focusing on achieving SDGs with a case study conducted in the Indian logistics sector. The study is structured into four phases. The first phase identifies 37 sub-MSRs, categorized into seven main MSRs, accompanied by the 39 MSSs for IRR freight transportation adoption. The second phase employs the spherical fuzzy Bayesian best-worst method (SF-BBWM) to assess the relative weights of main and sub-MSRs. The third phase uses the spherical fuzzy C-means clustering (SF-CMC) algorithm to identify crucial MSSs. Finally, the fourth phase utilizes the spherical fuzzy combinative distance-based assessment (SF-CODAS) to prioritize these crucial MSSs. From the identified MSSs, pivotal solutions include developing an integrated physical IRR network across the freight transport chain and fostering relationships between stakeholders through long-term contracts and strategic partnerships. The available results are discussed to facilitate logistics stakeholders’ understanding of the implementation of MSSs aligning with SDGs to mitigate the impact of MSRs.}

In this empirical work based on socio-cyber-physical assemblage thinking, first we found that on-site material and immaterial conditions like living on the farm, farm settings, and creative human work still matter and deserve more attention in responsible digital agriculture. Second, in our small sample we found that internet and cloud-computing are the main digital technologies used in on-farm diversification, particularly infrastructures-as-a-service and software-as-a-service. Third, when farmers introduce digital technologies in their diversification, three tentative configurations of socio-cyber-physical assemblages are outlined and can be further assessed in future research: punctiform, horizontal, and vertical configurations, or a combination thereof. For each configuration, we illustrate key features and examples. Nine clusters of factors were identified as affecting these assemblages. These factors could help researchers and practitioners to understand why the digitalisation of diversified farms can be so diverse and needs to be carefully adapted. For policymakers, these factors can also serve to qualify the setting up of conditions to steer integrated agri-food-rural policies towards on-farm diversification, including responsible digitalisation. The paper argues that digitalisation in agriculture can unfold through different strategies (minimising, mutualising, grounding, enlarging digitalisation) and requires holistic and ambitious policy commitments for sustainability. For example, the paper suggests the setting up of a new EU-wide target for increasing the share of farmers engaged in on-farm diversification through the Common Agricultural Policy or European Farm-to-Fork Strategy.}

abstract = {The Digital Transformation of firms is in an incipient stage despite being essential for competitiveness. Hence, the objective of the present study is to analyse which factors are important in the realisation of an Organisation 4.0. To this end we revise the literature to analyse the concept of Industry 4.0, identifying which technologies are necessary for this fourth industrial revolution, and the process of becoming an Organisation 4.0. A model is then proposed with the antecedent variables required for an Organisation 4.0, which include the roles of innovation, business intelligence and digital employees. The model is tested through a sample of 198 firms using the structural equations technique. Although technologies 4.0 have usually been considered as facilitators of innovation, the present study finds the opposite relationship, i.e. that innovation is a necessary antecedence for Organisation 4.0. It is also found that this stimulus is reinforced by Business Intelligence systems and that innovation strengthens the presence of digital employees. However, we have not been able to show how these digital employees contribute to the formation of an Organisation 4.0. More research is needed on the employee knowledge, skills and capabilities required for the implementation of an Organisation 4.0.}

Smart manufacturing has ushered in a new era of using technological innovations in the manufacturing process; the processes involved exhibit rapidly increasing complexities. Many of the founding techniques and paradigms of traditional quality control (QC) methods are not able to handle all these dynamics. Therefore, in the last decade, traditional quality management philosophies have plateaued, and QC professionals started stagnating with little innovation to offer. Today, the industrialization of artificial intelligence (AI) is a megatrend that dominates the business landscape, and it requires the attention of industry managers. The application of AI to manufacturing systems for QC and improvement drastically improves upon the zero-defects vision proposed by Crosby. Consequently, the industrialization of AI offers an excellent opportunity for quality professionals to return to their lead roles in the manufacturing sector.}

abstract = {Corruption and lack of transparency remain critical challenges in governance systems around the world. These issues are often perpetuated by centralized systems and their manipulation by system administrators. Furthermore, the lack of data ownership and the monetization of user data by tech companies further increase concerns about transparency. In light of these concerns, this study aims to review existing blockchain-based governance models and identify best-practice governance models focusing on corruption transparency, their characteristics, and components. The research will also examine the role of a token economy in addressing trusted third-party issues related to asset ownership management. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of smart contracts, blockchain, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), Web 3.0, and multifactor challenge set self-sovereign identity authentication (MFSSIA) as modern technologies to combat corruption and achieve transparency in the public sector. To achieve this, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) comprising peer-reviewed journals, proceedings, and book chapters published between 2012 and 2023. Using the SLR methodology, 45 primary and supporting studies have been selected for result extraction and analysis. Finally, we discovered seven blockchain-based governance models with their characteristics and primary components.}

With the advancement of games technology there is an increasing opportunity for educators to provide innovative assessment tools for students on their courses which are highly immersive and graphically indicative of the times. This could potentially be in a supplementary capacity or to a greater extent inextricably linked to the learning outcomes and assessment outcomes. Notably serious games and Games-Based Learning (GBL) have received high levels of attention from educationalists due to being motivational, novel learning approaches. This paper will outline two empirical studies conducted to develop a game to teach programming at HE level. The first study will gauge the acceptability of a computer game for teaching programming and formulating content integration development requirements. The second study will outline the evaluation of the developed game being placed in a module as a formative assessment tool to assist learners to revise for their formal class test. Study one showed that acceptability of the game was high with 61 participants completing an acceptability/content integration questionnaire. The game was designed to consolidate knowledge on rudimentary and advanced programming concepts, data structures and algorithms. 48 participants evaluated the game in study two with the results generally indicating that they enjoyed playing the game as a revision alternative with 14% of participants rating it as very effective and 51% of participants as effective for allowing them to prepare for their class test. The majority of participants also believed that games could be utilised in a formative and summative assessment capacity on courses for independent study.}
