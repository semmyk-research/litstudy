abstract = {Industry 4.0 is collaborating directly for the technological revolution. Both machines and managers are daily confronted with decision making involving a massive input of data and customization in the manufacturing process. The ability to predict the need for maintenance of assets at a specific future moment is one of the main challenges in this scope. The possibility of performing predictive maintenance contributes to enhancing machine downtime, costs, control, and quality of production. We observed that surveys and tutorials about Industry 4.0 focus mainly on addressing data analytics and machine learning methods to change production procedures, so not comprising predictive maintenance methods and their organization. In this context, this article presents a systematic literature review of initiatives of predictive maintenance in Industry 4.0, identifying and cataloging methods, standards, and applications. As the main contributions, this survey discusses the current challenges and limitations in predictive maintenance, in addition to proposing a novel taxonomy to classify this research area considering the needs of the Industry 4.0. We concluded that computer science, including artificial intelligence and distributed computing fields, is more and more present in an area where engineering was the dominant expertise, so detaching the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to address Industry 4.0 effectively.}

Within the concepts of smart science and technology, smart environment, and smart built environment, the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology can be categorized. Since these characteristics of a smart city include subcategories, which consider Sci-Tec research and development, sustainable and safe transport systems, inter/national connectivity infrastructure, sustainable resources management, sustainable/green energy resources, Hi-Tec construction technology, and advance building technology. The smart city, status, and goals depend on each particular case, and each particular city features. These goals are measured by means of indicators, which are based on existing urban and building infrastructure, resources, codes, standards, and regulations. The smart-city model, proposed in PAS 182:2014, is intended to create a data-driven city, integrating city systems, with operational independence and operational efficiency. The modern infrastructure should be versatile, diversified, normalized, and its physical components may vary. In such way, there should be a clear strategy of balancing the development of existing and emerging or planned infrastructure. In order to achieve the goals and objectives of the smart-city planning, multidisciplinary teams should work together (engineers, architects, politicians, planning authorities, etc.), which final outcome should be an integrated economics, urban planning, architectural design, and sustainable construction. The main focus of this chapter is to put in context the previous developments made in V2G technologies as well as their considerations, constrains, and advantages—to take them as a starting point for future research topics related to the methods, simulations, and analysis presented in this document.}

In order to develop a sustainable, scalable and resilient e-Participation system, a new blockchain concept, which organizes the blocks as a neural system, is combined with the implementation of a virtual token to reward participants. Furthermore, this virtual token is deployed through a smart contract that the block itself produces, containing information about the transaction and all the documents involved in the process. Finally, our Neural Distributed Ledger (NDL) framework facilitates the interconnection of blockchain networks in a transparent, certified, secure, auditable, scalable and traceable way.}

Therefore, this review aims at giving an overview on different research areas in the emerging topic of UAM. To this end, findings from several fields within the UAM research community were gathered and are presented here to provide a landscape of relevant questions surrounding the implementation of UAM. This overview considers vehicle-related aspects, such as aircraft requirements and aircraft classification for intra- and inter-city passenger transport, and discusses potential hurdles to their introduction. The exploration of challenges includes questions on certification and policy, as well as challenges in the area of traffic management and ground infrastructure requirements. Besides that, literature on operational concepts, possible market structures and the interaction with existing transport systems will be reviewed. The discussion of hurdles will conclude with a summary of current literature on public acceptance of UAM. An overview of methods for modelling and simulation of UAM will wrap up the prior discussion and provide insights on first modelling results.}

Smart homes have become central in recent technology and policy discussions about energy efficiency, climate change, and innovation. However, many studies are speculative, lacking empirical data, and focus on costs and benefits, but not business models and emerging markets. To address these gaps, our study presents data from semi-structured expert interviews and a review of the recent literature. Although we draw from empirical data collected in the United Kingdom, we place our findings in the context of Europe because the UK has access to European markets for smart home technologies and platforms. Our sampling strategy included experts from Amazon, Microsoft, the International Energy Agency, government, academic, and civil society stakeholders. We identify a diversity of definitions associated with smart home technologies and draw from our data to discuss applications centred on digital connections, enhanced control, automation, and learning. We analyse fifteen distinct business models for smart home technologies, ranging from energy services and household data monitoring to assisted living, security and safety, and new advertising channels (among others). Our assessment ought to guide future innovation patterns, technology deployment, and policy activity relating to smart homes, especially insofar as they can deliver energy services more affordably or help meeting carbon mitigation priorities.}

Second, the paper uses descriptive evidence to show that the growth landscape has indeed shifted decisively in favor of developing countries in the Internet Age in comparison to the pre-internet period. Third, using rigorous econometric techniques with data of 163 countries over a 20-year period, 1996–2016, the paper evidences that developing countries on average reap significantly greater growth gains from internet adoption in comparison to the average advanced country.

However, different terminologies, namely smart manufacturing (SM) and intelligent manufacturing (IM), have been applied to what may be broadly characterized as a similar paradigm by some researchers and practitioners. While SM and IM are similar, they are not identical. From an evolutionary perspective, there has been little consideration on whether the definition, thought, connotation, and technical development of the concepts of SM or IM are consistent in the literature. To address this gap, the work performs a qualitative and quantitative investigation of research literature to systematically compare inherent differences of SM and IM and clarify the relationship between SM and IM. A bibliometric analysis of publication sources, annual publication numbers, keyword frequency, and top regions of research and development establishes the scope and trends of the currently presented research. Critical topics discussed include origin, definitions, evolutionary path, and key technologies of SM and IM. The implementation architecture, standards, and national focus are also discussed. In this work, a basis to understand SM and IM is provided, which is increasingly important because the trend to merge both terminologies rises in Industry 4.0 as intelligence is being rapidly applied to modern manufacturing and human–cyber–physical systems.}

Critical to the growth of Industry 4.0 is the coordination among supply chain entities, in particular when Industry 4.0 is proposed to improve sustainability efforts. Studies in green supply chain literature have often considered the market expansion effects of greening efforts. However, a number of other factors influence greening efforts, a critical one being the price premium effect driven by the brand building strategy of firms. A principal issue then arises as to which strategy should firms adopt and when does each greening effect benefit firms and supply chains more. We generate several insights into this important issue by developing models considering dyadic settings, competition, and cost-sharing contract. We examine strategic decisions in these channel structures and compare and contrast our results with the market expansion based models. We identify a number of counter-intuitive results, for example, a dyadic channel with high price-sensitive consumers would benefit more from the price premium effect and cost-sharing (when it focusses on building brand) than market expansion. We also conduct intra-channel and inter-channel comparison of outcomes to understand the effect of competition. Among other results, we find that in the presence of a dominant retailer and competing manufacturers, the retailer shares more greening cost with the manufacturer than the corresponding decentralized channel.}

Driven by concerns of privacy, national security, surveillance, and cyber terrorism, governments around the world have been erecting barriers in cyberspace through data localization. The extent of data localization varies from free flow of data, to stringent restrictions requiring all data to be stored only within the territorial jurisdiction of the country. Though there are certain legitimate concerns regarding protection of personal data, scholars and liberal economists have long proclaimed that any restrictions on the Internet and associated digital trade will have serious economic consequences. Data localization affects digital trade between consumers and producers of digital services to varying degrees. In this paper, we use agent based modeling to study the properties and behaviours of consumers and producers under varying data localization regimes. An augmented gravity model of trade with iceberg coefficient is incorporated to reflect distance-related costs between producers and consumers. Varying data localization compliance costs are included to reflect the effect of non-tariff barriers of data restrictions. Our extensive simulations indicate that there is often clustering of consumers around local firms in highly restrictive data localization regimes, thus enabling local firms to effectively compete against global multinationals. However, results also indicate that while free cross-border data flow enables intense competition amongst producers, data localization restrictions often limit consumer choice due to its effect on price and quality of services.}

Business operations are undergoing drastic changes due to the disruptive effects of technology innovations; however, there is insufficient knowledge regarding the acceptability and consequences of the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) in the education sector. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), this study explores the readiness of the education sector for 4IR. We adopted face-to-face semi-structured interviews to explore the views of 33 key stakeholders in the education sector, to understand the readiness and acceptability of 4IR in the sector. Findings show that the education sector, especially in Africa, is unprepared for 4IR, although there are indications for opportunities to harness the potential of the much-anticipated 4IR. Moreover, our study demonstrates a mutual symbiotic relationship between the education sector and technology innovations. The findings show that 4IR can facilitate students’ learning experience and transforms the workplace, although there is a need to assess the learning environment, to understand the facilitators and barriers to 4IR diffusion. The findings indicate the opportunity for the education sector to harness the innovations associated with 4IR through research and teaching to enhance learners’ experience; however, this may require a significant improvement in education curricula, as well as investments. The findings contribute to the theory and practice of technology in education and the limited literature on 4IR in the education sector, particularly in Africa.}

In addition, we describe the real motivations for banks to explore Blockchain, and problems they face. In order to have a good understanding of the industry, a qualitative method was adopted, and sixteen experts were interviewed. It was identified that knowledge hiding in Blockchain was common and the rationale behind was analyzed using the TPB (Theory of Planned Behavior) approach. The analysis results suggested that knowledge hiding was due to affective, behavioral and cognitive evaluations. The interviewees also provided several recommendations and success factors to overcome current issues in Blockchain adoption. Therefore, four important propositions have been developed. Finally, this article suggests how financial services should respond to this new technology and how to manage knowledge sharing in a more structured way.

A comprehensive review of the literature regarding the application of blockchain in the construction domain found that there are few studies and applications of blockchain in construction practices, and most of the current research involves qualitative studies only. In this paper, we aim to explore the feasibility of applying both public blockchain and private blockchain technologies in the construction industry using two industry cases. Two business process cases (i.e., Case 1 and Case 2) were selected and used to drive the blockchain-based software system architecture design. The proposed architectures were demonstrated using Hyperledger Fabric (a private, permissioned and open source blockchain platform) and Ethereum (a public blockchain platform) respectively, to reflect the different requirements of the two use cases. This pilot study also illustrates the process, benefits, and challenges of adopting private and public blockchain technologies in construction domain.

abstract = {Resilience enables supply chains to reduce their proneness to disruptions and recover faster. Many existing strategies to strengthen the resilience of supply chains are facilitated by the use of digital technology. Blockchain, as one of the promising innovative technologies, enables a transparent, secure, and timely data exchange and automation via smart contracts. In this paper, we discuss the impact of blockchain technology on supply chain risk management and, in particular, on supply chain resilience. We identify potential risk-related blockchain application scenarios and examine their impact on the existing resilience strategies. We explore the impact of the most promising applications with respect to resilience by using an agent-based simulation model of a complex supply network affected by disruptions. The theoretical analysis reveals a promotion of supply chain resilience strategies, especially if smart contracts are used for risk-related collaboration. The simulation study indicates an increase in resilience if the underlying collaboration is based on time-efficient processes: The propagation of disruptions, the network recovery time, and total costs can be substantially reduced. However, depending on the duration of the disruption, negative effects can occur if process efficiency is insufficient. From our investigations, we derive insights for managers who are interested in practical implementation.}

abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within the United Nations 2030 Agenda emerged in 2015, becoming an unprecedented global compass for navigating extant sustainability challenges. Nevertheless, it still represents a nascent field enduring uncertainties and complexities. In this regard, the interplay between digitalization and sustainability unfolds bright opportunities for shaping a greener economy and society, paving the way towards the SDGs. However, little evidence exists so far, about a genuine contribution of digital paradigms to sustainability. Besides, their role to tackle the SDGs research gaps remains unexplored. Thus, a holistic characterization of the aforementioned topics has not been fully explored in the emerging literature, deserving further research. The article endeavors a twofold purpose: (1) categorizing the main SDGs research gaps; (2) coupled with a critical exploration of the potential contribution of digital paradigms, particularly Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, towards overcoming the aforesaid caveats and pursuing the 2030 Agenda. Ultimately, the study seeks to bridge literature gaps by providing a first-of-its-kind overview on the SDGs and their nexus with digitalization, while unraveling policy implications and future research directions. The methodology has consisted of a systematic holistic review and in-depth qualitative analysis of the literature on the realms of the SDGs and digitalization. Our findings evidence that the SDGs present several research gaps, namely: flawed understanding of complexities and interlinkages; design shortcomings and imbalances; implementation and governance hurdles; unsuitable indicators and assessment methodologies; truncated adoption and off-target progress; unclear responsibilities and lacking coordination; untapped role of technological innovation and knowledge management. Moreover, our results show growing expectations about the added value brought by digitalization for pursuing the SDGs, through novel data sources, enhanced analytical capacities and collaborative digital ecosystems. However, current research and practice remains in early-stage, pointing to ethical, social and environmental controversies, along with policy caveats, which merit additional research. In light of the findings, the authors suggest a first-approach exploration of research and policy implications. Results suggest that further multidisciplinary research, dialogue and concerted efforts for transformation are required. Reframing the Agenda, while aligning the sustainable development and digitalization policies, seems advisable to ensure a holistic sustainability. The findings aim at guiding and stimulating further research and science-policy dialogue on the promising nexus amid the SDGs and digitalization.}

A Delphi approach is used to collect, synthesise, and seek consensus across expert viewpoints. Over sixty experts across a range of geographies including the US, Europe, New-Zealand, Australia, Africa, India and China participated. They identified 26 trends, 20 step changes, and 26 innovations that could lead to major shifts in the design, operation, or management of electricity systems. Findings suggest that key challenges are not technological. Instead they are with delivering an aligned vision, supported by institutional structures, to incentivise, facilitate, and de-risk the delivery of a completely different type of energy system. There is a clear role for government and policy to provide a future energy vision and steer on strategic issues to deliver it; to create space for new actors and business models aligned with this vision; and to create an environment where research, development, demonstration and deployment can promote technologies, system integration and business model innovation at a rate commensurate with delivering net-zero electricity systems.}

In this paper we analysed digital and industrial policies of four Sub-Saharan African countries (South Africa, Rwanda, Kenya, Nigeria) and three East Asian and Pacific countries (China, Thailand, Philippines) regarding their expectations about the impacts of ICTs in industry for environmental sustainability. We built on existing frameworks for the assessment of ICTs that distinguish between direct environmental effects which occur during the lifecycle of ICTs and indirect environmental effects which result from the application of ICTs in a variety of production processes and economic activities. We used qualitative content analysis to explore and analyse policy expectations regarding both direct and indirect environmental impacts of ICTs in industry. Our analysis showed that policies express a broad range of vague expectations focusing more on positive indirect impacts of the use of ICTs, e.g. for enhanced energy efficiency and resource management, than on negative direct impacts of ICTs, e.g. electricity consumption of ICTs. Moreover, expectations differed between countries and there was no shared theme that emerged in all policies. We suggest that policies must go beyond awareness of selected opportunities towards the integration of a more systemic understanding of interlinked direct and indirect impacts and pursue targeted measures to employ ICTs as tools for environmentally sustainable industries.}

However, not all are equals in terms of access to networks or connected devices, or when it comes to the skills required to navigate computerized spaces optimally. Digital inequalities were already existing, yet the COVID-19 crisis is exacerbating them dramatically. On the one hand, the crisis will worsen digital inequalities within the population. On the other hand, digital inequalities represent a major risk factor of vulnerability for exposure to the virus itself, and for the non-sanitary consequences of the crisis. Therefore, this paper aims at exploring the reciprocal impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and digital inequalities, and to propose operative solutions to help fight the nefarious consequences of the crisis. We first describe how digital inequalities are a determinant of health. We then investigate how COVID-19 can potentiate digital inequalities, and how digital inequalities potentiate vulnerability to COVID-19. Finally, in order to contribute to the mitigation of this crisis, we propose a set of multi-layered strategies focusing on actionability that can be implemented at multiple structural levels, ranging from governmental to corporate and community levels.}

Our findings reveal a transformation of the Nigerian cybercrime industry from low-tech cyber-enabled crimes to high-tech sophisticated breaches, with viruses, worms or Trojan infections; electronic spam mails; and hacking being the top three most experienced breaches. In term of cyber security practices, banking professionals have received adequate management in both support and training. The lack of advanced technologies to prevent and address cyber security breaches and the unsatisfactory level of legislative compliance, together, appear to be the primary factors that have reduced cyber security capability in our sample of banks.}

HR development is one of the principles of SHRM that should be implemented consistently along with other SHRM principles, which means, e.g., that the development of employees should be carried out having a long-term perspective in mind. It is crucial to acquire the so-called competencies of the future as the basis for implementing the idea of Industry 4.0. The purpose of the article is to present the development of human potential in an organization against the background of other detailed sustainable HRM principles, to be followed by confronting the theory and the research results on the development of future competencies referring to industrial engineers in Poland as the professional group responsible for implementing the idea of cleaner production and Industry 4.0. The Author analyzed the results of three research projects based on the survey method and representative data from Eurostat and Statistics Poland. The conducted research shows that industrial companies in Poland have more of a short-sighted perspective when it comes to developing the potential of their engineers. The HR development practices focusing only on current needs are not in line with the SHRM principles of a long-term perspective and flexibility. There is also a visible lack of employee participation in the process of making training-related decisions, which is another principle of sustainable HRM. In addition, environmental sustainability remains a neglected area of knowledge in terms of training, and the cooperation with external educational institutions is low. It results in certain implications for HR managers and educational institutions. The article also presents directions for further research.}

Sketching the arguments from the resource-based view as well as the contingency approach, a model for Industry 4.0 adoption is developed. Eight hypotheses encompassing the intrinsic and extrinsic barriers to digitalisation, digitalisation practices, and two constructs of firm performance constitute the model, which is tested on 143 manufacturing companies using Analysis of Moment Structure (AMOS). The findings suggest that intrinsic and extrinsic barriers are negatively linked with the digitalisation. The analysis also reveals that Industry 4.0 adoption improves operational performance as well as supply chain competency. The paper sheds light on the contingency effects of extrinsic barriers on digitalisation. This research would assist the practitioners and policymakers to comprehend the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic barriers.}

Manufacturing companies, especially small and medium-sized ones, are facing various challenges and must constantly innovate to remain competitive. One way to innovate is by implementing new technologies into company processes. In this study, we investigate how technology, company and industry related factors are associated with the implementation of Industry 4.0 in SMEs. We collect data via a survey with a focus on Industry 4.0 in SMEs. The results indicate that knowledge and expected benefits of technology are the drivers for the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies. They also show that companies with high levels of process automation and high product variety are more likely to implement Industry 4.0 technologies. Our study creates a better understanding of the status, challenges and plans within Industry 4.0 implementation in SMEs, which will support the development of SME-friendly manufacturing tools and systems and craft managers’ and policymakers’ understanding of Industry 4.0 technologies.}

With that have also come initiatives for guidance on how to develop “responsible AI” aligned with human and ethical values. Compared to sectors like energy, healthcare, or transportation, the use of AI-based techniques in the water domain is relatively modest. This paper presents a review of current AI applications in the water domain and develops some tentative insights as to what “responsible AI” could mean there. Building on the reviewed literature, four categories of application are identified: modeling, prediction and forecasting, decision support and operational management, and optimization. We also identify three insights pertaining to the water sector in particular: the use of AI techniques in general, and many-objective optimization in particular, that allow for a pluralism of values and changing values; the use of theory-guided data science, which can avoid some of the pitfalls of strictly data-driven models; and the ability to build on experiences with participatory decision-making in the water sector. These insights suggest that the development and application of responsible AI techniques for the water sector should not be left to data scientists alone, but requires concerted effort by water professionals and data scientists working together, complemented with expertise from the social sciences and humanities.}

Business with ethical and sustainable operations has become the need of the day in the present environment of Industry 4.0 and circular economy. It has been observed that the application of Industry 4.0 technologies may help in achieving the goal of ethical and sustainable operations. Although a lot of research has been done in context to larger enterprises, limited research is available on the application of Industry 4.0 technologies in SMEs for ethical and sustainable operations. The espousal of Industry 4.0 technologies is a challenging task for SMEs due to various operational and financial constraints. The problem is more acute, specifically in context to developing countries like India. Keeping in mind the role of technologies in ethical business and circular economy, we have identified fifteen challenges, impacting the application of Industry 4.0 technologies in SMEs. A questionnaire was designed for collecting the response from industry and academic experts. On the collected data, the DEMATEL approach has been applied to check the degree of influence and interrelationship among challenges. It has also helped in the categorization of factors as cause and effect. Sensitivity analysis is also performed to validate the results obtained from the DEMATEL approach. Authors have observed that lack of motivation from partners and customers on the application of I4.0 technologies is the leading challenge. Fear of failure of I4.0 technologies is the main effect group challenge. The findings of the study will help SMEs in formulating strategies for implementing Industry 4.0 technologies for ethical and sustainable business processes.}

A sustainability-oriented model for evaluating the influence of Industry 4.0 technologies on sustainable metrics is proposed. This model analyses the impact of Industry 4.0 technologies on several key performance indicators related to sustainable development. The model was tested in the plastics industry which has a high potential of Industry 4.0 technological aggregation in emerging economies. A fuzzy TOPSIS multi-criteria method was used to classify Industry 4.0 technologies, identifying those with the strongest and weakest impacts on sustainable development. As a result, we show that the internet of things, cyber-physical systems, sensors, and big data implementation are drivers for sustainable development. We also evidenced that these technologies are associated with substantial positive impacts on economic metrics. However, there was a much smaller positive influence on environmental and social metrics, suggesting an imbalance on the Triple Bottom Line perspective for the plastics industry. In addition, we found negative impacts from robots on job creation and low influence from cloud computing and system integration technologies for sustainable development. Based on these findings, our work contributes to the decision-making process by aiding managers, process engineers, and stakeholders in understanding and estimating the expected impacts from Industry 4.0 technologies on economic, environmental, and social aspects for sustainable development.}

Despite the wide plurality of perspectives, the diversity of contents, the variety of voices, and the many often-conflicting reasons for publishing, our interactions with information on digital devices are progressively shaping such situations and affecting decisions on all levels. We look at the limitations of existing designs and guidelines in the current paradigm, and we ask to what extent researchers and developers can focus and contribute, through their innovations, to the reduction of uncertainty and cases of misdirection, how they can mitigate tensions between information and humans, and how they can contribute to the maintenance and enhancement of worthy human values. Human-engaged computing (HEC) calls for innate user capacities to be enhanced rather than displaced by digital technologies so that the human factor in interactions is fully exploited and truly efficient symbiotic relationships between humans and devices can be achieved. Under the framework of HEC, we propose 12 research agendas from the theoretical, principled, and practical aspects, in order to develop future synergized interactions between humans and information. The present crisis presents us with a good opportunity to reflect on the need to empower humans in relation to the tools they use and to consider the next paradigm shift for designing information interaction.}

While smart cities affect many dimensions of city management, applications to safety management belong to the most controversial, revealing important tensions between disparate perspectives on technology and society in the context of urban living environments. Despite their influence, the concepts of smart cities and smart urban safety are largely unknown to the public. To gain insights into citizens’ perspectives, this study uses smart urban safety vignettes to which participants are invited to respond. Using discourse analytical techniques, their interpretations of safety in the smart city are described, which center on functional designs, express lacking influence over technological developments, and reflect on benefits and risks and on their civic roles vis-à-vis technologically mediated urban safety management. Our article concludes by arguing how these findings complement, but also show limitations to traditional technology acceptance models that are as of yet dominant in research of smart urban safety specifically, and smart cities more generally.}

It creates more interest to the researchers to work towards Flow-based SDN for the priority-driven algorithm in anomaly intruder detection. In this paper, we made a study towards a priority-based model using SDN to control the flow of data packets over the network, gives assurance to the bandwidth enforcement, and reallocation is made through virtual circuits. The network behavior of the system is continuously monitored through the machine learning model for normal and abnormal traffic data transmission to detect anomaly intruders. Flow-based machine learning (ML) model with SDN act as an intelligent system to limits the throughput virtually through the flow of reserved bandwidth and make use of extra bandwidth, which presents more than the utilization bandwidth for priority-based applications with minimal cost while compared with the traditional methods. The proposed work also compared with the schemes available at the network to produce outcomes with fast routing and the fault tolerance of existing networks to overcome the gap open at the security of the SDN architecture to detect and identify vulnerabilities.}

Successful methods for scaling-up evidence-based programs are needed to prevent skin cancer among adults who work outdoors in the sun.
Methods
A randomized trial is being conducted comparing two methods of scaling-up the Sun Safe Workplaces (SSW) intervention. Departments of transportation (DOTs) from 21 U.S. states are participating and their 138 regional districts were randomized following baseline assessment. In districts assigned to the in-person method (n = 46), project staff meets personally with managers, conducts trainings for employees, and provides printed materials. In districts assigned to the digital method (n = 92), project staff conduct these same activities virtually, using conferencing technology, online training, and electronic materials. Delivery of SSW in both groups was tailored to managers' readiness to adopt occupational sun safety. Posttesting will assess manager's support for and use of SSW and employees' sun safety. An economic evaluation will explore whether the method that uses digital technology results in lower implementation of SSW but is more cost-effective relative to the in-person method.
Results
The state DOTs range in size from 997 to 18,415 employees. At baseline, 1113 managers (49.0%) completed the pretest (91.5% male, 91.1% white, 19.77 years on the job, 66.5% worked outdoors; and 24.4% had high-risk skin types). They were generally supportive of occupational sun safety. A minority reported that the employer had a written policy, half reported training, and two-thirds, messaging on sun protection.
Conclusions
Digital methods are available that may make scale-up of SSW cost-effective in a national distribution to nearly half of the state DOTs. Trial registration: The ClinicalTrials.gov registration number is NCT03278340.}

To help port policymakers develop cybersecurity measures, this study conceptualized and developed three dimensions of port cybersecurity hygiene (i.e. human, infrastructure, and procedure factors) and investigated the relationships between port cybersecurity hygiene and cyberthreats (i.e. hacktivism, cyber criminality, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism, and cyber war). A questionnaire survey was used to collect data from all international container port operators and shipping lines with branches in Thailand, and the proposed relationships were tested by structural equation modeling. The results indicated that container ports tended to encounter hacktivism when their human, infrastructure, and procedure factors were vulnerable. The weakness of the human factor could also lead to cyber terrorism, while the deficiency of the infrastructure factor could lead to cyber criminality. Moreover, container ports were likely to be harmed by cyber espionage if their procedure factor was poorly implemented. Hence, the provision of training and education to all port workers, including top executives, managers, and supervisors, are necessary to ensure a cyberthreat-awareness culture at all organizational levels. Improving cybersecurity equipment could prevent unauthorized access to port business data and keep important information secure, while the ISPS Code-based procedures and other preventive measures should be strictly implemented by container ports to reduce the risk of cyberthreats.}

Maturity models (MMs) are valuable methodologies to assist manufacturing organizations to track the progress of their I4.0 initiatives and guide digitalization. However, there is a lack of empirical work on the development of I4.0 MMs with clear guidelines for OSCM digitalization. There is no I4.0 MM with an assessment tool that addresses the imprecision brought by human judgment and the uncertainty and ambiguity inherent to OSCM evaluation. Here we develop a fuzzy logic-based I4.0 MM for OSCM, through a transparent and rigorous procedure, built on a multi-method approach comprising a literature review, interviews, focus groups and case study, from model design to model evaluation. To provide a more realistic evaluation, fuzzy logic and Monte Carlo simulation are incorporated into an I4.0 self-assessment readiness-tool, which is connected with the model architecture. The proposed model has been validated through a real application in a multinational manufacturing organization. The results indicate that the approach provides a robust and practical diagnostic tool, based on a set of OSCM indicators to measure digital readiness of manufacturing industries. It supports the transition towards I4.0 in OSCM domain, by holistically analyzing gaps and prescribing actions that can be taken to increase their OSCM4.0 maturity level.}

In order to stay competitive, both these transitions need to follow sustainable resource management and digital transformation principles. However, there are barriers to these changes that organizations should consider. Both Industry 4.0 transition, in other words Industry 3.5, and circularity transition require great efforts to deal with these barriers; in the current environment, organizations need to deal with these barriers simultaneously for more sustainable resource management. This study focuses in particular on circular supply chains in the Industry 3.5 stage. There are some studies that suggest barriers to Industry 4.0 and circular supply chains separately, none of these studies consider them together. From this point of view, this study contributes to existing literature by presenting synchronized barriers that integrate circular supply chain and Industry 4.0 barriers. Firstly, pillars of circular supply chains in Industry 4.0 are explained; synchronized barriers are then presented. A decision-making method, Fuzzy Analytical Network Process, is used to prioritize the synchronized barriers, with theoretical and practical implications proposed according to the result of the implementation.}

Regardless of this objective, building a comfortable and sustainable city for the citizens by putting the quality of life at the center of the city, is one of these responsibilities. In fact, the issue of the way how city administrations change especially with global and technological changes requires a detailed analysis. In this context, critical issues like transportation, health, education, energy, and environment are among the topics to be examined. Of course, rather than providing these services by their names, the responsibilities of meeting the services, the management procedures, the economic and technological situation of the city, the forms of urban intervention against the risks and problems that may occur, and the sustainability of the service are very important. The reason for looking at these services on a city-specific basis is that urban infrastructures use a large proportion of energy usage outside the large production-oriented facilities. Water, energy, and transportation are the most critical infrastructures in the growing cities with increasing population. Moreover, it is unchanging that in the 2050s, probably about 60% of the world’s population will live in cities. In this study, recommendations are given about how an ideal city management should be in some of the critical city services and current state-of-the-art studies are listed.}

abstract = {Given a scale expansion of Internet of Things for sustainable resource management in smart cities, proper design of an intrusion detection system (IDS) is critical to safeguard the future network infrastructure from intruders. With the growth of connected things, the most-widely used centralized (cloud-based) IDS often suffers from high latency and network overhead, thereby resulting in unresponsiveness to attacks and slow detection of malicious users. In this paper, we address the limitation of centralized IDS for resource-constrained devices by proposing two methods, namely semi-distributed and distributed, that combine well-performing feature extraction and selection and exploit potential fog-edge coordinated analytics. In order to distribute the computational tasks, we individually develop parallel machine-learning models corresponding to a partitioned attack dataset. In the semi-distributed case, the parallel models, running on the edge side, are applied for side-by-side feature selections, which are then followed by a single multi-layer perceptron classification running on the fog side. In the distributed case, the parallel models individually perform both the feature selection and multi-layer perceptron classification after which the outputs are combined by a coordinating edge or fog for final decision making. Based on the comparative study of existing works, the numerical results demonstrate the promise of the proposed methods, giving a comparable detection accuracy to the superior centralized IDS as well as exemplify their inherent trade-offs between the accuracy and building time performance.}

abstract = {Modular integrated construction (MiC) is an innovative construction technology wherein complete building modules are produced and preassembled in an offsite factory before their final installation on the building site. It is fundamentally different from and has many advantages over the traditional onsite construction technology. However, it still involves several risks. To successfully implement MiC projects, effective MiC risk management (MiCRM) is crucial. Building information modeling (BIM) and BIM-related digital technologies have been applied to facilitate MiCRM in recent years. While numerous MiC studies exist, a critical analysis of BIM-based MiCRM is still missing. This study aims to conduct a critical survey of BIM-based MiCRM, and to offer recommendations about research gaps and future research directions. This was achieved by systematically identifying and critically reviewing related publications from four outlooks: (1) MiCRM through BIM used alone, (2) MiCRM through BIM used alongside sensing and tracking technologies (STTs), (3) MiCRM through BIM used alongside 3D model creation and comparison technologies (3D-MCCTs), and (4) other applications. Results indicated that using BIM alone for MiCRM has focused more on the design phase. The overall idea to use BIM-STTs integration for MiCRM is very young. In this direction, BIM-RFID integration has received most of the attention, although BIM-GIS integration is rarely explored. There are limited works around integrating BIM with 3D-MCCTs such as photogrammetry and augmented and virtual realities for MiCRM. While schedule- and cost-related risks have gained much attention in current BIM-based MiCRM research, facilities management, sustainability, and safety risks are largely ignored. Based upon identified gaps, this study suggested future research directions, including, e.g.: (1) BIM-based MiCRM software development, (2) fully automated and practical BIM-based MiCRM systems development, and (3) BIM-automatic rule checking integration for MiCRM. This study contributes to a solid understanding of BIM-based MiCRM and delivers a useful reference for its future practice and improvement within the industry.}

The system uses the OpenFlow protocol to split the multicast groups of GOOSE messages, in which each transmission is analysed separately. The implemented intelligent system used 62 prediction steps with a percentage relative error of up to 5%. The system was embedded in the ZYBO development platform with the OpenMul controller. The results showed that the percentage relative error of each sample presents a determinant signature for classifying the state of operation of the electrical system, making it possible to identify DDoS attacks in communication networks for electric power substations.}

Importance degrees of criteria are determined with the IVIF AHP method. The validity of the proposed model is verified, employing a real case concerning the Turkish airline industry. The results show that the most significant dimension is digital trust, and the three most important criteria are proactive customer service, cybersecurity, and customer insight.}

Ophthalmology has thrived in some of these areas partly due to its many image-based investigations. Tele-health and AI provide synchronous solutions to challenges facing ophthalmologists and healthcare providers worldwide. This article reviews how countries across the world have utilised these digital innovations to tackle diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, refractive error correction, cataract and other anterior segment disorders. The review summarises the digital strategies that countries are developing and discusses technologies that may increasingly enter the clinical workflow and processes of ophthalmologists. Furthermore as countries around the world have initiated a series of escalating containment and mitigation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of eye care services globally has been significantly impacted. As ophthalmic services adapt and form a “new normal”, the rapid adoption of some of telehealth and digital innovation during the pandemic is also discussed. Finally, challenges for validation and clinical implementation are considered, as well as recommendations on future directions.}

Technological advancements and the 4th Industrial Revolution are critical tools to help achieve this. However, they also present many challenges to traditional NDM systems by altering the fundamental operational, organizational, and social dynamics of conventional disaster management. Currently, there is a lack of research that studies these aspects beyond technology and examines the impact of digital transformation on the full life cycle of disaster management on the national level. Therefore, this research fills this gap by integrating interdisciplinary concepts from different research fields including Disaster Management, Information Systems, and Business Management to understand the impact and determinants of digital transformation in NDM systems. To achieve this, the research uses the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework and conducts semi-structured interviews with UK NDM experts. The results show that the impact of digital transformation on NDM is profound, paradoxical, multi-directional, and driven by a multitude of driving forces. This research makes many significant contributions to research and practice. Theoretically, this research expands the TOE framework beyond its original underpinnings by uncovering a new set of disaster-context determinants. It also presents an innovative Layered Cake FAST (Foundations-Approach-Strategy-Technology) Model that offers a unique roadmap for NDM on how to handle its digital transformation journey. Practically, the research presents several sets of useful expert-recommended actions.}

During the period from 1960 to 2015, the world population has increased from about 3 billion to over 6 billion. During the same period, the municipal solid waste quantities have more than doubled globally (from 1.5 million tons/day in 1960 to 4.0 million tons/day in 2015). Due to relatively short use times, especially for high tech consumer products, the number of obsolete products and waste quantities have been increasing exponentially. The American Chemical Society has identified 44 of the 118 elements in the periodic table as endangered and to become extinct in their ore forms within the next 80 years. Nine elements are in serious threat of extinction in the next 100 years, 7 are in rising threat from increasing use elements, and 28 are in future risk of supply. Some elements used in high tech products and industrial applications (e.g., cordless power goods, LCD displays, wind turbines, magnets, rechargeable batteries, smartphones) have shown significant oscillations in their prices during the last decade. Price oscillations for some elements are likely to occur more frequently and with increasing amplitudes in the coming decades as their availability is jeopardized due to increasing demand as well as political and economic challenges for materials supply. Mechanisms for establishing effective waste management and recycling infrastructures for discarded products, similar to that of supply chain management, are needed for sustainable use and management of available material ores on Earth's crust that can support the infusion of technology and use in consumer products.}

As a consequence of their idiosyncratic characteristics, the usefulness and validity of existing product innovation management concepts cannot be transferred to the context of DPI without further ado. Accordingly, this study reinvestigates the role of IT-C in the specific context of DPI. Therefore, we begin with a differentiation of DPI from traditional, non-digital product innovation. Then, we propose that IT-C affect the performance of DPI projects via two paths. First, based on the notion that DPI rely on the use of innovative IT, we assume that IT-C directly impact DPI performance. Second, following prior research that has argued that the performance contribution of IT-C is mediated by other organizational intermediaries, we assume that IT-C also indirectly contribute to DPI performance through their positive influence on other organizational capabilities. One such organizational capability that mediates the influence of IT-C on DPI performance is a firm’s DPI capabilities (DPI-C). DPI-C allow firms to deploy their digital resources for DPI purposes and, thus, are an important antecedent for DPI performance. To test our assumptions, we use partial least squares–structural equation modeling technique and analyze survey data collected from DPI projects across different industries in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.}

These theoretical perspectives permit a detailed and rigorous content analysis of EU strategy for gas security where thematic-network analysis proves to be exceptionally productive. This article identifies five overarching features of the EU strategy for gas security: interconnectedness, interoperability, coordination, protection, and moderation. Vulnerabilities and threats to EU gas security are discussed and addressed for each of these. Processes and measures, considered essential to withstanding these identified threats and vulnerabilities, are examined for each feature as well. A process-oriented model for European gas security that reflects the logic of the EU strategy is generated by the analysis. This model is built upon the logic guiding the relations of subordination and how the identified processes are integrated with each other.}

VR environments may aid students' efforts to be active learners through consciously attending to, and reflecting on, critique leveraging reflexivity and novel meaning-making most likely to lead to a conceptual change. This paper employs eleven industrial case-studies to highlight the application of multimodal VR-based teaching and training as a pedagogically rich strategy that may be designed, mapped and visualized through distinct VR-design elements and features. The outcomes of the use cases contribute to discern in-VR multimodal teaching as an emerging discourse that couples system design-based paradigms with embodied, situated and reflective praxis in spatial, emotional and temporal VR learning environments.}

This is often referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). Project leaders and practitioners are not fully leveraging the opportunities unlocked by the 4IR, and project performance shows little sign of improvement despite the highly innovative and collaborative environment that the 4IR stimulates. This paper discusses this challenge and concludes that a significant reason why these benefits are not being realised is because there is a competence gap in both the project leader and practitioner communities. These communities are attempting to deal with twenty-first-century issues using competences, toolsets and a mindset created 100 years ago. Significant developments in competences associated with the 4IR in general are required. In this paper, specific competences are proposed and justified: collaborative working including people, process and digital components; lean six sigma; and agile. Success will be to empower the people who deliver megaprojects such that they are able to deliver the planned social value to all stakeholders involved.}

However, blockchain has not been examined comprehensively in all areas of relevant literature. This article conducts a survey of the literature to gain an understanding of the opportunities and issues presented by blockchain in various business functions. The article begins by providing a discussion regarding how the blockchain technology operates. The paper takes a broad focus in its analysis of the prospects of blockchain for various business functions, including banking and the capital markets, corporate governance, international trade, and taxation. The paper demonstrates how organisations and regulators can leverage blockchain to upscale business operations, enhance efficiency and reduce operational costs. The key drawbacks of blockchain that stakeholders need to bear in mind before adopting the technology are also highlighted. The article also reflects on how organisations can tap into blockchain to reap the full potential of the fourth industrial revolution.}

They are overall public solutions that combine the design and implementation of intelligent systems mainly for electricity, water, and natural gas in addition to tens of different assets like public transportation, healthy environment, water, sanitation with key principles of the “green economy.” Solutions for these systems are luckily driven both by businesses and governments in order to increase resource efficiency. However, due to rapid population growth and limited resources available, very effective urban management is needed in order to meet the requirement for smart utilities to increase the quality of public life in the city by using information and communication technologies. Nowadays, while we live together with digital technologies, mobility, Internet and data communication infrastructure, cloud computing services, etc., our local administrations try to quickly adapt to these developments and show their motivations with successful examples in the area. In this chapter, we will first examine the needs and expectations of the customers, residents who use smart utilities and services and provide general information about these services. We will also discuss the need for energy, the availability of resources, the balance of supply and consumption from the point of consumers and providers, intelligent infrastructures. Secondly, we will start with the electricity, the most important energy source of our daily life, and continue with water, waste water, and natural gas in order to give very detailed information for each in separate sections. In the sections related to the different utilities, the existing resource status, different resource alternatives, applied regulation, smart grids generated, and smart customer usage metering will be given with examples from current studies.}

At the same time, a clear understanding of the current lay of the land is necessary to assist in public sector decision-making and policy development. To address this gap, this bibliometric study presents a bibliographic analysis of extant literature in the field, as referenced as the focal topic of concern in academic journal articles spanning 1995–2019. The aim is to provide an overview of the origins of the entrepreneurial ecosystems concept in literature, to offer insight into key concepts that have emerged in research over the past twenty-five-years. The paper employs bibliographic techniques to track knowledge, identify trends, and highlight the primary emerging patterns and conceptual clusters. The analysis offers a map of the covered territory and facilitates the identification of gaps and under-researched areas in the field, with a particular focus on public sector interaction. Using the visualization of similarities, VOSviewer, software tool, citation, co-citation, co-authorship, as well as the co-occurrence of keywords are presented to offer a comparative overview of the diverse representation of entrepreneurial ecosystems developments across disciplines, countries, institutional clusters, networks and teams.}

Based on interviews with leading figures in municipalities, smart city consultants and key figures in technological companies (n = 40), the aims of this paper are to assess the efforts of cities to become smart by responding to the following questions: 1. What is guiding the decision-making process in developing technological initiatives? 2. Does context play a role in implementing technological initiatives? 3. How are the residents perceived, and what tools are being used to address residents' digital differences? The key argument of this paper is threefold: first, in the process of becoming a smart city, the roles of public and private actors are blurred, influencing the process of decision making. Second, despite contextual differences, cities adopt similar digital initiatives. Third, technological initiatives that focus on social needs and address inequality in the digital age are still at the margins. The final discussion suggests that most municipalities are still at an early stage of digitization implementation and have the ability to shape and form a vision for the cities as socio-technological ecosystems in a way that will serve their publics as a whole. The paper ends with a call for shifting the focus from the city to society in developing digital initiatives and cultivating smart social urbanism.}

In open laboratories where no such hardware is available, users establish sovereignty in other ways as they step beyond the design and construction of artefacts and get involved in a wider scope of sense-making and agenda-setting behaviours. Using the example of an open lab project on IT security for critical infrastructures, this paper tries to gain a better understanding of these behaviours. Due to the sensitivity of IT security, visitors of the lab are not allowed to get directly involved in the fabrication or alteration of technical architectures, algorithms, etc. Nevertheless, the visitors engage in a variety of other do-it-yourself activities in their approach to the subject matter and the project itself that add new facets to the notion of user sovereignty in hacking and making.}

As a response, many governments have introduced mandatory notification schemes in which an entity bears an obligation to notify the regulator and affected individuals if personal data it holds is compromised. Focusing on Australia’s Notifiable Data Breach (NDB) scheme introduced in 2018, this paper points out that the NDB scheme gives entities that should be responsible for data protection much leeway while holding individuals, only victims of a data breach, responsible for dealing with the consequences. This is problematic as redressing the grievances caused by a data breach is difficult in the Australian context. It is difficult for a victim of a breach of privacy to bring an action in court mainly because there is no established tort of privacy in Australia. Further, bringing a class action for data breaches is a difficult process. We suggest that the real effect of the NDB scheme requires an understanding in a broader context of Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). Regulated in a broader APPs context, the NDB scheme could become a part of a privacy protection regime that requires public agencies and businesses to have better accountability and responsibility mechanisms.}

We create a framework to help convey country-level risks concerning DPS and inform comprehensive policy recommendations.  The study reveals country-level data privacy and protection practices and provides recommendations for country-level risk assessment exercises.

An extensive literature review of select information science and organizational strategy literature is used to identify key characteristics of tourism EEs and situate the concept within a ‘tourism as system’ perspective. The resultant models demonstrate that tourism EEs represent an expanding meso-level experience space made up of actors engaged in multiple types of activities, complemented by an ever-expanding set of interactions, and driven by a variety of entrepreneurial behaviors and technological innovations. Theoretical implications suggest that future research should employ dynamic measurement approaches to understanding and measuring EE performance vis-a-vis the disruptive impact of digital technology. Practical implications for governments, communities, and global tourism organizations include the need for governance systems to expand opportunities for current EE players while encouraging the entry of new players through the creation of new tourism ventures.}

Even though previous studies have examined organisational aspects of information security, not much focus has been placed on human factors. In the present work we examined the tendency to morally disengage (MD), information security awareness (ISA), and counterproductive work behaviours (CWB), in a sample of 718 employees who used computers on daily basis, in order to establish predictors of CWB and the behavioural outcomes of ISA. The results showed that the propensity to morally disengage plays an important role in ISA, particularly the aspect of diffusion of responsibility. Secondly, ISA knowledge and ISA attitude, as expected, were part of a mediating mechanism underlying the relationship between MD and ISA behaviours, as well as MD and CWB. This demonstrates that ISA and CWB constructs overlap to a certain degree, and thus affecting one, should have effects also on the other. Targeted interventions need to consider ways of improving ISA knowledge and attitudes, as well as employees’ sense of responsibility for the information they work with.}

abstract = {Swarm Intelligence (SI) is a popular multi-agent framework that has been originally inspired by swarm behaviors observed in natural systems, such as ant and bee colonies. In a system designed after swarm intelligence, each agent acts autonomously, reacts on dynamic inputs, and, implicitly or explicitly, works collaboratively with other swarm members without a central control. The system as a whole is expected to exhibit global patterns and behaviors. Although well-designed swarms can show advantages in adaptability, robustness, and scalability, it must be noted that SI system have not really found their way from lab demonstrations to real-world applications, so far. This is particularly true for embodied SI, where the agents are physical entities, such as in swarm robotics scenarios. In this paper, we start from these observations, outline different definitions and characterizations, and then discuss present challenges in the perspective of future use of swarm intelligence. These include application ideas, research topics, and new sources of inspiration from biology, physics, and human cognition. To motivate future applications of swarms, we make use of the notion of cyber-physical systems (CPS). CPSs are a way to encompass the large spectrum of technologies including robotics, internet of things (IoT), Systems on Chip (SoC), embedded systems, and so on. Thereby, we give concrete examples for visionary applications and their challenges representing the physical embodiment of swarm intelligence in autonomous driving and smart traffic, emergency response, environmental monitoring, electric energy grids, space missions, medical applications, and human networks. We do not aim to provide new solutions for the swarm intelligence or CPS community, but rather build a bridge between these two communities. This allows us to view the research problems of swarm intelligence from a broader perspective and motivate future research activities in modeling, design, validation/verification, and human-in-the-loop concepts.}

abstract = {The development of dynamic data-based Decision Support Systems (DSSs) along with the increasing availability of data in the industry, makes real-time data acquisition and management a challenge. Intelligent automation appears as a holistic combination of automation with analytics and decisions made by artificial intelligence, delivering smart manufacturing and mass customization while improving resource efficiency. However, challenges towards the development of intelligent automation architectures include the lack of interoperability between systems, complex data preparation steps, and the inability to deal with both high-frequency and high-volume data in a timely fashion. This paper contributes to industrial frameworks focused on the development of standardized system architectures for Industry 4.0, closing the gap between generic architectures and physical realizations. It proposes a platform for intelligent automation relying on a gateway or middleware between field devices, enterprise databases, and DSSs in real-time scenarios. This is achieved by providing the middleware interoperability, determinism, and automatic data structuring over an industrial communication infrastructure such as the OPC UA Standard over Time Sensitive Networks (TSN). Cloud services and database warehousing used to address some of the challenges are handled using fog computing and a multi-workload database. This paper presents an implementation of the platform in the pharmaceutical industry, providing interoperability and real-time reaction capability to changes to an industrial prototype using dynamic scheduling algorithms.}

Where many AI processes are technologies hidden from view of the citizen, how can public institutions support and ensure these high levels of trust, transparency, and openness in Nordic culture and extend these concepts of “digital trust” to AI? One solution is by authoring national policy that upholds cultural values and personal rights, ultimately reinforcing these values in their societies. The paper highlights differences in how Nordic nations position themselves using cultural values as organizing principles, with the author showing these values (i.e., trust through clear information and information security, transparency through AI literacy education and clear algorithmic decision making, and openness by creating data lakes and data trusts) support the development of AI technology in society. The analysis shows that three cultural values are upheld and influence Nordic national AI strategies, while themes of privacy, ethics, and autonomy are present, and democracy, a societal building block in the Nordics, is especially prominent in the policies. For policy development, policy leaders must understand that without citizen involvement in AI implementation or lacking citizen AI education, we risk alienating those for who these services are meant to utilize and improve access for.}

abstract = {Small to medium enterprises (SMEs) are often marked by limited resources, a high dependence on others, and a scope of business that gets narrower as they seek to adapt to the current dynamic and knowledge-intensive context. Additionally, in their relationship with multinational enterprises (MNEs), SMEs are driven to a continuous specialization of their knowledge and technological resource bases. They so source global knowledge by positioning along a global value chain of those MNES. Especially SMEs employ a repositioning organizational knowledge dynamics by functional upgrading and downgrading strategy. In order to address the query on dynamic capabilities in knowledge management (KM) in different inter-organizational collaborations in the global value chain, this study shows that the choice between functional upgrading or downgrading can determine a more effective cross-innovation strategy which enables SMEs to exploit external paths to the market by revealing or selling their ideas, knowledge and technologies. Such strategies can reveal opportunities for SMEs to increase their network to find an optimum position in the market. SMEs, in turn, become more specialised in their offerings, moving up or down the global value chain, leveraging on a combination of dynamic and technological capabilities along with high degree of involvement in knowledge management process. This scenario is investigated through the study of 532 European knowledge-intensive SMEs via structural equation modelling. Hence, results offer relevant implications for policy-makers and SMEs managers in better employing the organizational ambidexterity for the repositioning strategy in the global value chain.}

abstract = {A smart city is an energy efficient and sustainable urban center that supplies a high-quality life for its users and dwellers. This is achieved through optimum management of its available and affordable resources. A smart city is defined as a city equipped with intelligent services and infrastructure that assure an improved quality of life with sustainable smart built environment solutions. Smart cities aim to attain a reliable, energy efficient, and high-quality power and thus smart grid becomes imperative. Energy management in smart cities would be one of the most demanding issues due to the complexity of the energy systems and their vital role. Significant attention and effort need to be focused directed and dedicated to efficiently solve this problem. Mathematical modeling and simulation are among the major tools commonly utilized to assess the technological and policy impacts of smart solutions, as well as to plan the best directions of shifting from current cities to smarter ones. Distributed energy systems, likely in the form of microgrids and combined heat and power—small, local energy system comprised of single or multiple entities that generate electric and thermal, energy and operate autonomously from or are integrated into the power grid. Energy and access to smart cities will become an even more integral part of modern living in cities. In other words, on top of addressing an unsustainable demand for energy, new energy systems must also be increasingly more reliable and resilient. Broad agreement among energy experts is that solar and wind remain to be the best candidates in terms of new major energy sources in smart cities, and should be considered as the backbone of future energy systems. Solar panels have made such substantial leaps since their inception a few years ago that prices have dropped drastically with the expansion of their utilization in the United States, Europe, and Middle East. However, the transition to hybrid solar-wind energy systems comes with its own set of challenges, limitations including current inefficiencies in present energy storage capabilities. This is quite apparent in the transportation sector, which exhibits the most trouble when anticipating its energy transition. Given the intermittent nature of wind and solar energy, it is also necessary to consider the present focus on traditional centralized power production and distribution, which if neither unchanged, nor developed will become harder to maintain. Evidently, hybrid wind and solar integration into our energy system implies significant investment in research, as well as improvement of equipment and deployment.}

However, this becomes increasingly speculative as one moves to more distant timelines and visionary technological forms. This raises the question of whether it is possible to rationally predict how a technology development trajectory might unfold into the future, perhaps to some ‘ultimate form’, that is accessible, surfaces the necessary technological features for development as well as considers the implications for human–artefact relationships. The proposed approach is conceptually grounded in a parsimonious framework that examines different configurations of human–artefact relationships, revealing ‘Six Genres of Technology’. This suggests how the shift from human-human to artefact-artefact and the increasing autonomy of the artefacts (technological beings), introduces specific features to each of the six Genres. Four features are identified in the later Genres that in combination, could be construed as, or indeed pose a threat: autonomy, intelligence, language, and autopoiesis. This paper advances the debate about future technological developments by using the proposed framework to structure an argument about the key issues that should be discussed today - so that the developments of tomorrow can be more reflectively considered, appropriately debated and knowingly pursued.}

However, the qualification of digital I&C systems remains a challenge, especially considering the issue of software common-cause failures (CCFs), which are difficult to address. With the application and upgrades of advanced digital I&C systems, software CCFs have become a potential threat to plant safety because most redundant designs use similar digital platforms or software in the operating and application systems. With complex designs of multilayer redundancy to meet the single-failure criterion, digital I&C safety systems (e.g., engineered safety-features actuation system [ESFAS]) are of a particular concern in the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing procedures. This paper applies a modularized approach to conduct redundancy-guided systems-theoretic hazard analysis for an advanced digital ESFAS with multilevel redundancy designs. Systematic methods and risk-informed tools are incorporated to address both hardware and software CCFs, which provide guidance to eliminate the causal factors of potential single points of failure in the design of digital safety systems in advanced plant designs.}

States have adopted a number of international instrument dedicated in full or in part to privacy and data protection, at multilateral or regional levels, in binding or non-binding form. This article discusses the potential and context of the emergence of a possible global standard on data protection focusing on the 1981 Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data, as amended (Convention 108+).
Aims
With due regard being paid to the dynamic technological and business environment that surrounds policy-making in the field of personal data protection, this article attempts to look at some strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges of Convention 108+ in the competition for becoming a global standard. It seeks to identify possible future directions and priorities, taking into account the evolving nature of international relations in a more multipolar world where multilateralism is less obviously the preferred approach to international issues.
Findings
Informed by an in-depth study of relevant international instruments relating to the right to privacy this article explores several strengths and opportunities that may be built on to promote a global role for Convention 108+, but also some weaknesses and threats. In sum, it concludes that the Convention is relatively well placed to ambition becoming a global standard.}

In particular, urbanisation trends and the increasing demands of urban mobility place additional pressure on existing transportation infrastructure, and this creates new challenges for urban planners in terms of developing integrated and sustainable urban mobility policies. Here, we take a novel and holistic approach to analysing transformative pathways towards sustainable urban mobility, considering the complex dynamics in metropolitan regions. To achieve this, we develop a toolset to assess the impact of potential measures to be taken by decision makers. Our innovative approach is based on the introduction of a new system framework to link the interrelated sector parameters of mobility systems by considering the effects of innovative mixed methods (both qualitative and quantitative) on scenario development and evaluation on the basis of global trends at the macro scale and their specific influences on the mobility sector at the local scale. To this end, we used a participatory modelling approach to develop scenarios and evaluate them as integrated simulation runs via a comprehensive and holistic system dynamics (SD) model. Thus, we estimated dynamic interdependencies between all of the factors relating to the mobility sector and then assigned business decision-making criteria to the urban systems. Furthermore, we introduced a sustainable net present value framework to estimate the sustainability outcomes of government investment in urban mobility infrastructure. A case study relating to the Rhine-Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region in Germany was applied in order to simulate four scenarios co-created with stakeholders involved in our study, namely, Smart City, Sustainable/Healthy City, Deurbanisation and Business-as-Usual (BaU), which served as a solid basis from which to quantify path dependencies in terms of policy implementation. At the same time, recommendations were derived for sustainable mobility transformation within metropolitan regions.}

abstract = {Background
With the introduction of privacy regulations such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), effective data protection in mobile health (mHealth) is rapidly becoming a concern. However, we have a limited understanding of the contexts and mechanisms that affect the likelihood of failures and successes in mHealth data protection, and their subsequent impacts. In this review and theory development paper, we aim to address this critical knowledge gap.
Method
We conducted a systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. To synthesize the evidence, we adopted a realist review approach and compiled the extracted information based on context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations. Out of an initial set of 611 records, 19 articles met the eligibility criteria and were included.
Results
Our findings indicate that the failures and successes in data protection and their impacts (effective mHealth interventions, data protection awareness, and adoption/use of mHealth systems) depend contingently upon a number of contextual factors (systems, users, tasks, services, geographic elements) and causal mechanisms (unauthorized access, device theft, loss, and sharing, lack of cyber-hygiene, and data protection concerns for failures, and trust building activity, secure and law compliant platforms, and perceived data protection, for successes). We conceptualized the CMO configurations to provide explanations for the reported failures and successes in data protection.
Conclusion
For effective mHealth interventions, the dark side of system use (data breaches) must be mitigated and remediated. Our study offers a theoretical model that contextually explains how the mechanisms of success and failures work in mHealth.}
