abstract = {Unlike previous reviews, most of which focus on a field and use qualitative methods to analyze blockchain technology, herein main path analysis was used to determine the key route of citations and identify the developmental trajectories of blockchain technology and its major themes. A total of 3159 blockchain-related articles published through August 5, 2019, were gathered from the Web of Science. In all, 2478 articles formed the citation network, 27 of which were on the key route. These 27 key papers on blockchain represented the four developmental stages. Stage 1 focused on challenges to bitcoin. Stage 2 focused on smart contract issues. Stage 3 focused on opportunities, challenges, and development in blockchain. Finally, Stage 4 focused on smart contract applications, especially in e-healthcare, where blockchain technology is paving the way to a quicker, more secure, and more efficient means of storing and accessing medical data. The Girvan-Newman clustering technique was used to classify articles, and keyword analysis was used to analyze the top six major themes. These were bitcoin security, bitcoin financial applications, e-healthcare, Ethereum smart contracts, security and privacy in IoT, and energy. Main path analysis was also used to analyze their developmental trends. The results have significant value for both academics and practitioners.}

abstract = {This research commentary proposes a 3-D implementation classification framework to assist service providers and business leaders in understanding the kinds of contexts in which more or less successful cashless payment solutions are observed at point-of-sale (PoS) settings. Three constructs characterize the framework: the digitalization of the local implementation environment; the relative novelty of a given payment technology solution in a country at a specific point in time; and the development status of the national infrastructure. The framework is motivated by a need to support cross-country research in this domain. We analyze eight country mini-cases based on an eight-facet (2 × 2 × 2) classification. A key insight is the distinction between local and national environments for solution implementations, and that there are no objective “low-tech” or “high-tech” payment solutions, but only those that must be calibrated by a country’s experience at the national or local implementation environment levels. Our analysis also revealed that implementing cashless payment solutions is complex, with each country and local context having its own set of challenges. Our proposed framework is a basis for policy-makers and payment service providers to developing insights related to the challenges of cashless payment solution implementation. Developing countries sometimes are able to leapfrog their legacy infrastructures by using mobile payment solutions, while developed countries need to appreciate the importance of barriers to implementation success, such as costs, settlement delays, and the habitual use of cash. We further note why business leaders should consider their approaches to payment solutions in view of the different degrees of local digitalization and national infrastructure development to support tech innovations in the digital economy.}

The present study aims to contribute to this research topic by explaining how Industry 4.0 may contribute to energy sustainability. The present study performs a content-centric qualitative review of the extant digitalization literature to identify the primary energy sustainability functions of Industry 4.0. The interpretive structural modeling technique is further used for mapping the interrelationships among various energy sustainability functions identified. The interpretive model developed, and the Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée àun Classement analysis offered exciting insights into the Industry 4.0-energy sustainability interactions. Findings show that Industry 4.0 promotes energy sustainability via a very complex mechanism that involves ten interrelated functions. Contrary to the general opinion, production efficiency offered by the digitalization of the manufacturing industry is not the immediate and most essential energy efficiency outcome of the digital industrial transformation. Industry 4.0 primarily contributes to energy sustainability by enabling the energy industry to reshape its operating landscape and enjoy more advanced, intelligent, and complicated energy production and distribution equipment. The digitalization of the energy demand sector, digitalization of the manufacturing industry, and the introduction of smarter and more sustainable products are among the main opportunities of Industry 4.0 for energy sustainability. Overall, the study and the ISM model of energy sustainability developed explains how Industry 4.0 contributes to energy sustainability via different functions and how each function is placed within the structural model based on its driving and dependence powers.}

Smart homes have become prominent in recent technology and policy discussions about energy efficiency, climate change, and the sustainability of buildings. Nevertheless, how might culture shape the diffusion and use of the technologies used in smart homes? What cultural barriers may impede their adoption, or embed more carbon-intensive lifestyles? Lastly, do smart home technologies truly promote sustainability goals? Based on an extensive original dataset involving expert interviews in four countries—Japan, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States—and original media content analysis, this study explores the cultural aspects of smart home technology adoption as well as the consequent impacts on sustainability. In doing so, the study elaborates on an array of social, technical, political, economic and environmental dimensions of smart home technology diffusion, with clear implications for research, policy, and technology development. In this sense, we call for more comprehensive, progressive, innovative and sensitive technology design so as to advance SHT adoption and fulfill some of the sustainability and climate objectives their advocates continually promise.}

Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged and forced out the ephemeral conventional approaches. Thus, the post-COVID world indicates the need for sustainable development and strategies in par with the ecosystem. The authors propose this study as a guide to direct the post-pandemic scenario into the sustainable pathway by prioritizing energy sustainability to engage the actions for achieving the SDGs. The analysis in this study commences with the investigation of pronounced impacts in the energy sector with its influence on the progress towards sustainability. To pursue the path of energy sustainability, a qualitative analysis is performed in a parallel approach from the key viewpoint of the renewable and sustainable energy transition, digital transformation of the energy sector and energy affordability in the post-COVID world. A SWOT-AHP hybrid methodology is employed to identify the significance of each strategy or issues to be focused on immediately in the post-COVID world. The study also discusses energy sustainability from political bodies and policy makers’ perspective, and the actual scenario where we are headed is revealed with the aid of process-tracing method. Furthermore, a novel quantitative analysis is established to represent the SDG’s interaction and the result shows that the SDG 7 is the underpinning goal in relative to other SDGs. In context with it, the mapping of energy sustainability to the sustainable world is accomplished. The ultimate inference from envisioning the SDGs through energy sustainability shows that a sustainable world would result after the pandemic. However, the changes in the energy market, investment preferences and more importantly, the decisions influenced by the political bodies in the post-COVID-world is decisive in achieving the same in a stipulated time frame.}

Service providers now play a more significant role, making their capabilities important. In the new context, service providers require a uniquely different set of dynamic capabilities to handle end-to-end business functions on behalf of their clients while delivering digital value propositions. We study 26 of the largest global business process outsourcing providers to conceptualise and identify six dynamic capabilities of service providers salient in the new context, i.e., consultative, orchestration, insights, network management, knowledge access, and standardisation. Interviews conducted with industry experts provided evidence in support of the identified dynamic capabilities. A novel firm capability dataset was created using secondary data, and using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), we identify configurations for high and low performance and find them to vary by the firm's broad/narrow scope.}

We perform an experiment to examine factors we predict will influence directors’ litigation risk. We examine whether jurors are more likely to hold directors liable when a company previously experienced an immaterial cyberattack, and whether subsequently implementing the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ cybersecurity risk management reporting and assurance framework (the “Framework”) can mitigate the effects of a prior attack. Consistent with counterfactual reasoning theory, we find jurors are more likely to hold directors liable for a cyberattack when a company previously experienced an attack. Importantly, we also find that directors can reduce this liability risk after a prior cyberattack by subsequently implementing the Framework, especially when they obtain external assurance. Our results have important implications for research, boards, regulators and public policymakers, audit firms, and attorneys who handle cybersecurity-related cases.}

This study adopts the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework to examine a comprehensive set of factors influencing the cyber security readiness of organizations and the effects of these factors on organizational performance (financial and non-financial) mediated by improved organizational security performance. Data are collected via a survey of IT professionals in Bahrain, with 270 valid responses. The results confirm the importance of seven of nine factors affecting cyber security readiness identified in previous studies. Cyber security readiness is found to positively impact organizational security performance, which in turn positively affects financial and non-financial performance. The newly proposed comprehensive model of factors affecting the cyber security readiness of organizations and the evidence of their importance can be used to guide future research and enhance the current understanding of how organizations can better equip themselves to minimize the occurrence and impact of cyber-attacks.}

Energy harvesting and distribution is automated through remotely operated commands using information and communication technology. Common issues in integrating power grid with technology include security threat that reduces the expected assimilation performance. In the present work, a cybersecurity-assisted authentication method for smart grids is introduced to overcome false data flow. This method pre-estimates the energy requirement of the meters, depending on previously acquired information. Authentication-dependent security is provided according to the pre-estimated energy requirement and distribution manner. Variations in smart grid data for energy allocation are monitored based on network and end-user consumption until the users' current connection time. This method provides individual authentication for power-sharing and user verification, thereby improving false data's detection rate. Results show that the proposed method required less detection time (4.67 s) without increasing the overload for end-users.}

We identify several ways by which the digital transformation may provide a context favourable to autistic workers. This includes creating new opportunities, valuing their performative abilities, cognitive differences and creativity, removing stereotypes and biases during the recruitment and improving the management of psycho-social risks. Neurodiversity management also contributes to the digital transformation by closing the digital skills shortage, shaping algorithms of artificial intelligence and providing a competitive advantage for innovation. Most importantly, neurodiversity management provides an effective model of inclusion that can mitigate the development of inequalities associated with the digital transformation.}

In the first phase, the influence of I4.0 on GRI standards is analyzed using basic descriptive statistics and analysis of variance. In the second phase, the significance of the GRI standards in the context of I4.0 is evaluated using the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The findings indicate that 85% of environmental, 65% economic, and 50% societal GRI standards are influenced by I4.0. It is also found that the influence on economic performance, indirect economic impacts, energy, and emissions are significantly high. Findings ratify that the social aspect, which is often overlooked, needs more focus in manufacturing. Most of the contemporary research on evaluating the impact of I4.0 on sustainability is conceptual, lacks comprehensiveness, and rigor by thorough testing and validation. This study is one of the pioneering works offering a conceptual framework that aids in integrating I4.0 with GRI.}

Furthermore, it is investigated whether the stakeholders involved in this ecosystem can create sufficient value to sustain in the market. The outcome of this research includes an economic model for evaluating the value creation and distribution among the stakeholders. This model is a critical step forward to better align the values (i.e., utilities and profits) of stakeholders. The simulation results of the model show that end users are the main source of value generation. Cybersecurity solution providers and cybersecurity information providers get benefits from a growing installed base of end users. However, in saturated markets, there is a risk of un-sustainability of the ecosystem, as the cost of cybersecurity solutions and cybersecurity information cannot be recovered through their fees. The simulation model and the findings of this study can help business managers to make better decisions related to business strategies, sustainability, and pricing schemes for cybersecurity solution and cybersecurity information. Moreover, a working cybersecurity information sharing ecosystem is essential for the adoption of cloud computing and, especially, edge computing. It allows capturing, disseminating, and aggregating cybersecurity information from a large number of computing devices and computing providers reliably and accurately.}

The upstream oil and gas (O&G) industry has been characterised as reluctant to adopt new technology. The analysis of three technology introduction case studies in the UK offshore O&G sector (including interviews with 22 personnel involved in developing and commercially buying new technology) confirmed the influence of 15 psychological factors on organisational technology adoption decision making. These have been organized into a framework (P-TAF) consisting of six categories of psychological constructs, namely: personality, attitudes, motivation, social, cognitive, and organisational factors. With further development, this preliminary framework can be used to develop interventions that support the successful technology uptake in O&G and in other sectors experiencing resistance to the introduction of new technology.}

Such implications are also in terms of the composition of actors, institutions, and patterns of interactions among those, along with the associated innovation processes.

Over the past few years, the internet and omni-channel domains have created a new economy that is growing rapidly and shifting the way in which businesses operate due to the influence of technological advancements and innovations. Now customers are embracing technology more than ever, user experience is becoming a crucial factor of the customer journey and remaining competitive in any industry is becoming increasingly difficult due to this. These changes have forced many businesses to rethink their presence, whether this is physically or digitally. In order to gain an understanding of how this should be approached, this paper focuses on demonstrating a critical understanding of innovation theories and concepts, which are utilised to enhance value for business. As well as this, web-based technologies and User Experience (UX) principles will be outlined and applied in order to create an online presence for a prototype supermarket, which will be then be reflected upon against PESTLE factors. From this, an innovative strategy will be formulated and evaluated for a new technology-based product/venture.}

In addition to image editing tools, creating natural-looking fake human faces can be easily achieved by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, malicious use of these new media generation technologies can lead to severe problems, such as the development of fake pornography, defamation, or fraud. In this paper, we introduce a novel Handcrafted Facial Manipulation (HFM) image dataset and soft computing neural network models (Shallow-FakeFaceNets) with an efficient facial manipulation detection pipeline. Our neural network classifier model, Shallow-FakeFaceNet (SFFN), shows the ability to focus on the manipulated facial landmarks to detect fake images. The detection pipeline only relies on detecting fake facial images based on RGB information, not leveraging any metadata, which can be easily manipulated. Our results show that our method achieves the best performance of 72.52% in Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC), gaining 3.99% F1-score and 2.91% AUROC on detecting handcrafted fake facial images, and 93.99% on detecting small GAN-generated fake images, gaining 1.98% F1-score and 10.44% AUROC compared to the best performing state-of-the-art classifier. This study is targeted for developing an automated defense mechanism to combat fake images used in different online services and applications, leveraging our state-of-the-art hand-crafted fake facial dataset (HFM) and the neural network classifier Shallow-FakeFaceNet (SFFN). In addition, our work presents various experimental results that can help guide better applied soft computing research in the future to effectively combat and detect human and GAN-generated fake face images.}

Most of food waste studies rely on quantitative analysis, which cannot reveal relevant details about the tensions and dynamics of collaboration. We conducted a qualitative study drawing on eighteen in-depth interviews - of managers of large multinational and local organizations covering different and relevant roles on the digital food supply chain - to investigate how organizational and food supply chain processes are affected by the digitalization of the operations along the food supply chain. By triangulating emerging findings with literature on supply chain management we discuss different views about collaborative practices for food waste prevention in the food supply chain and provide insights on how supply chain design and firms' operations have been re-conceptualized with the usage of digital technologies and on the institutional forces both limiting (barriers) and fostering (drivers) the diffusion of the digital food supply chain.}

abstract = {Objective
The COVID-19 pandemic and its socio-economic impacts have disrupted our health systems and society. We sought to examine informatics and digital health strategies that supported the primary care response to COVID-19 in Australia. Specifically, the review aims to answer: how Australian primary health care responded and adapted to COVID-19, the facilitators and inhibitors of the Primary care informatics and digital health enabled COVID-19 response and virtual models of care observed in Australia.
Methods
We conducted a rapid scoping review complying with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews guidelines. Two reviewers independently performed the literature search, data extraction, and synthesis of the included studies. Any disagreement in the eligibility screening, data extraction or synthesis was resolved through consensus meeting and if required. was referred to a third reviewer. Evidence was synthesised, summarised, and mapped to several themes that answer the research question s of this review.
Results
We identified 377 papers from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase. Following title, abstract and full-text screening, 29 eligible papers were included. The majority were “perspectives” papers. The dearth of original research into digital health and COVID-19 in primary care meant limited evidence on effectiveness, access, equity, utility, safety, and quality. Data extraction and evidence synthesis identified 14 themes corresponding to 3 research questions. Telehealth was the key digital health response in primary care, together with mobile applications and national hotlines, to enable the delivery of virtual primary care and support public health. Enablers and barriers such as workforce training, digital resources, patient experience and ethical issues, and business model and management issues were identified as important in the evolution of virtual primary care.
Conclusions
COVID-19 has transformed Australian primary care with the rapid adaptation of digital technologies to complement “in-person” primary care with telehealth and virtual models of care. The pandemic has also highlighted several literacy, maturity/readiness, and micro, meso and macro-organisational challenges with adopting and adapting telehealth to support integrated person-centred health care. There is a need for more research into how telehealth and virtual models of care can improve the access, integration, safety, and quality of virtual primary care.}

There is a recent trend to move such tools to edge networks (closer to the users and the IoT/IIoT systems) to address limitations, especially latency and security issues, in cloud-based solutions. However, protecting edge networks against zero-day attacks is challenging, due to the volume, variety and veracity of data collected from the large numbers of IoT devices in edge networks. In this paper, we propose a Distributed Anomaly Detection (DAD) system to discover zero-day attacks in edge networks. The proposed system uses Gaussian Mixture-based Correntropy, a novel ensemble one-class statistical learning model, which is designed to effectively monitor and recognize zero-day attacks in real-time from edge networks. We also design an IoT-edge-cloud architecture to illustrate the complexity of edge networks and how one can deploy the proposed system at network gateways. The proposed system is evaluated using both NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets. The findings reveal that the proposed system achieves better performance, in terms of detection accuracy and processing time, compared with five anomaly detection techniques.}

abstract = {Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies have received significant interest in various areas beyond the financial sector, with profound applications in the Internet of Things (IoT), providing the means for creating truly trustless and secure solutions for IoT applications. Taking into account the weak security defences that the majority of IoT devices have, it is critical that a blockchain-based solution targeting the IoT is not only capable of addressing the many challenges IoT is facing, but also does not introduce other defects, e.g. in terms of performance, making its adoption hard to achieve. This paper aims at addressing the above needs by providing a comprehensive and coherent review of the available blockchain solutions to determine their ability to meet the requirements and tackle the challenges of the IoT, using the smart home as the reference domain. Key architectural aspects of blockchain solutions, like the platforms’ software and network setups, the consensus protocols used, as well as smart contracts, are examined in terms of their ability to withstand various types of common IoT and blockchain attacks, deliver enhanced privacy features, and assure adequate performance levels while processing large amounts of transactions being generated in an IoT environment. The analysis carried out identified that the defences currently provided by blockchain platforms are not sufficient to thwart all the prominent attacks against blockchains, with blockchain 1.0 and 2.0 platforms being susceptible to the majority of them. On the other side, privacy related mechanisms are being supported, to varying degrees, by all platforms investigated; however, each of the them tackles specific only privacy aspects, thus rendering the overall privacy evaluation a challenging task which needs to be considered in an ad-hoc basis. If the underlying consensus protocols’ performance and fault tolerance is also considered, then only a small number of platforms meet the requirements of our reference IoT domain.}

I submit a new lens toward internationalization advantages for multinationals: new O (open resource advantage), L (linkage advantage), and I (integration advantage). While these new OLI advantages are complementary and coupled with traditional OLI (ownership, location, and internalization) advantages, digital globalization slackens conventional OLI benefits and solidifies the new ones. This article offers insights into how multinationals leverage new OLI advantages and manage global business with digital connectivity in order to improve speed, flexibility, orchestration, and efficiency for both interfirm and intrafirm activities.}

Typically, ML algorithms are exploited to classify/recognize data traffic on the basis of statistical features such as inter-arrival times, packets length distribution, mean number of flows, etc. Dealing with the vast diversity and number of features that typically characterize data traffic is a hard problem. This results in the following issues: (i) the presence of so many features leads to lengthy training processes (particularly when features are highly correlated), while prediction accuracy does not proportionally improve; (ii) some of the features may introduce bias during the classification process, particularly those that have scarce relation with the data traffic to be classified. To this end, by reducing the feature space and retaining only the most significant features, Feature Selection (FS) becomes a crucial pre-processing step in network management and, specifically, for the purposes of network intrusion detection. In this review paper, we complement other surveys in multiple ways: (i) evaluating more recent datasets (updated w.r.t. obsolete KDD 99) by means of a designed-from-scratch Python-based procedure; (ii) providing a synopsis of most credited FS approaches in the field of intrusion detection, including Multi-Objective Evolutionary techniques; (iii) assessing various experimental analyses such as feature correlation, time complexity, and performance. Our comparisons offer useful guidelines to network/security managers who are considering the incorporation of ML concepts into network intrusion detection, where trade-offs between performance and resource consumption are crucial.}

Thus, real-time recovery plays an important role in facing real-time cyberattacks. This paper proposes a novel max-min integer programming model subject to a budget constraint to improve network connectivity of a compromised digital logistics network via a strategy of maximising algebraic connectivity. Due to the NP-hardness of the maximisation problem, the optimal solution may not be found quickly. Thus, several heuristic algorithms, including greedy algorithms, tabu search and relaxed semidefinite programming (SDP) with rounding, are proposed. Verification of these heuristic algorithms is achieved by applying them, firstly to a hypothetical network, then to a large scale-free network which mimics a digital logistics network.}

abstract = {Personal information protection and privacy interact in diverse ways, especially in the contemporary information age. Although books and articles have focused on this topic, the new tendencies of worldwide legislation and judicial practice bring challenges, as the legal construction of personal information protection and privacy differs from culture to culture and time to time. In 2017, the General Provisions of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China (“the General Provisions of the Chinese Civil Code” hereafter)11The General Provisions of the Chinese Civil Code that took effect on October 1, 2017, is regarded as the opening chapter and the general provisions of the Chinese Civil Code enacted in 2020. (expired) addresses the legal concepts of personal information protection and the right to privacy simultaneously, to which this article refers as the dual model, differing from the one-dimensional mode of privacy protection before. Subsequently, the “The Right to Privacy and the Protection of Personal Information,” a chapter of the newly issued Civil Code of the People's Republic of China's (“the Chinese Civil Code” hereafter), ascertains the dual model and details related provisions. It has been dubbed a landmark ruling of China's personal information protection, greatly boosting the modernization of China's civil system. Despite the many articles that discuss approaches to China's civil protections, little attention has been given to the fundamental question concerning what exactly encompasses the personal information protection and privacy to which these laws refer. Based on the regulations and applicability of the General Provisions of the Chinese Civil Code and the Chinese Civil Code, this paper explores the legal construction of personal information protection and privacy under Chinese legal orders, including the differences, similarities, and interplay between the two rights. By distinguishing the legal value, contents and remedial approaches, this paper concludes that the two rights are distinct but overlap. On one side, personal information protection is elevated to the status of a separate civil right in the legal context of China, rather than part of privacy. On the other side, tailored regulations should be establish according to the criteria of the nature of information, the extent of information processing, and the elements of damage when confronted with overlaps in the two rights in judicial practice. Thus, this paper provides a perspective from which to clarify the approaches to civil protection of personal information and privacy in China and a reference model for enactment of the Chinese Personal Information Protection Law in the future.}

It is expected that e-commerce volume amounted to 29 trillion USD in the world in 2017, and would grow with the spread of the Internet and information and communication technologies (ICTs). Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS), together with many others, consider e-commerce a means to facilitate rapid, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, improving the living standards and alleviating poverty. This article examines areas for potential cooperation by BRICS countries in e-commerce development across rural and remote areas to fight poverty. It analyses the current state of e-commerce development in rural and remote areas in each of the BRICS countries, including cases of public and private initiatives to support it. The article also defines the opportunities which e-commerce brings to people living in rural and remote areas. Moreover, it evaluates the existing challenges and risks. The article concludes that despite the rapid e-commerce development in BRICS countries, and significant opportunities created, there are still issues of disproportionate e-commerce in varied regions and the lack of BRICS cooperation in this sphere. Based on a comparative and normative in-depth, systematic analysis, the article develops a set of recommendations for deepening BRICS countries’ cooperation in the following areas: infrastructure in rural and remote regions; education; consumer protection; online dispute resolution; coordinated policy in the international scene, including representation of BRICS countries in international indexes, such as the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Digital Services Trade Restrictiveness Index (STRI).}

abstract = {The aim of this study is to determine the effects of Industry 4.0 technology components on the organizational performance of businesses. Industry 4.0, the latest phase of the industrial revolution and one which is garnering a lot of attention, offers a number of benefits to businesses such as efficiency, speed, quality, personalised production, and reduced costs. Therefore, results which can be achieved through the initial adaptation of businesses to Industry 4.0 are among today's most compelling technological issues. In this context, the idea of determining the effects of Industry 4.0 components on businesses, specifically on their organizational performance, is the main aim of this research. As part of “Turkey's Digital Roadmap” (2018), created by the Ministry of Science, Industry, and Technology, the province of Kayseri in Turkey was investigated within the scope of the country's plans to digitize industry. The province of Kayseri, with an intensive number of businesses there using more technology, is one of Turkey's leading industrial and commercial regions. The fact that these enterprises use the latest technologies in their production processes has enabled the acquisition of the correct data for this research. Accordingly, enterprises using Industry 4.0 technologies and working on behalf of Industry 4.0 in the Kayseri Organized Industrial Zone have been determined as the main target group for this data. In this context, data was collected using face-to-face interviews, surveys, and second-hand data collection methods with executives in businesses using Industry 4.0 technologies and those adapting themselves to the process. The findings of the study reveal that Industry 4.0 technology components affect the organizational performance and this effect is positive. The findings of this study are consistent with the findings in the literature. More broadly, the findings show that Industry 4.0 technology components increase organizational performance criteria such as profitability, sales, production amount, production amount per capita, capacity utilization rate, production speed, product quality, and can lead to significant reductions in production costs. These results are encouraging for businesses wanting to transition to Industry 4.0 and are important in terms of filling in the gaps in the literature and practice. They also reinforce previous research highlighting the key role of digital technologies in value enhancement to achieve organizational performance. In this context, the scientific contribution of the research is the statistical verification of the proposed theoretical framework with production sector application.}

In particular static gains from trade for advanced economies are generally estimated to be small, while empirical evidence around growing employment and inequality challenges suggest trade’s role may be larger than previously thought, though still only one of many contributing factors. The focus on static gains though likely understates substantially the dynamic gains, as trade’s role in spurring faster economic growth, in both developed and developing countries through competitive and innovative forces. The dynamic, competition and innovation angle suggests a need for industrial policies to be revisited and examine how spillovers play out in the global economy. At the same time significant technological disruption is occurring through digital technology, big data, and machine learning/AI techniques that often require advanced capabilities and have significant competition implications. In recent COVID-19 pandemic policy responses governments have dramatically increased spending and liquidity to support stressed firms and households and encouraged many countries to consider strategic efforts to build certain domestic capabilities with the aim of reducing dependence on trade for emergency related goods and services. This paper provides insights on the specific role of innovation policies, and they differ from and are similar to traditional industrial policies, and what that might mean for future trade rules.}

The adoption of Smart Manufacturing Systems in manufacturing companies is often seen as a strategy towards achieving improvements in productivity. However, there is little evidence to indicate that UK manufacturing SMEs are prepared for the implementation of such systems. Through the employment of a triangulation research approach involving the detailed examination of 36 UK manufacturing SMEs from three manufacturing sectors, this study investigates the level of awareness and understanding within SMEs of Smart Manufacturing Systems. The development of a profiling tool is shown and is subsequently used to audit company awareness and understanding of the key technologies, collaborative networks and systems of SMS. Further information obtained from semi-structured interviews and observations of manufacturing operations provide further contextual information. The findings indicate that whilst the priority technologies and systems differ between manufacturing sectors, the key issues around the need for developing appropriate collaborative networks and knowledge management systems are common to all sectors.}

While the main motive of malware designers is to make surplus profit illegally, other trivial motives range from activism and pranks, espionage, cyber theft, as well as serious crimes like privacy breaches. Policing the expanding attack surface needs the development of competent anti-malware solutions with more generalization to detect even zero-day malware and resolve their incidences with minimal human intervention. Anti-malware solutions pick up effective strategies from static, dynamic, reverse engineering, and advanced machine learning techniques. An arms-race situation always exists between the malware authors and the anti-malware community. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of computer-based and mobile-based malware, their countermeasures, and various detection methods. We also discuss the additional issues and the challenges of malware detection and finally highlight a few open research issues, directing the trends of malware/anti-malware development.}

BIM provides the capabilities of cost reduction, increase quality, enhanced productivity, and on-time delivery. Despite the numerous advantages of BIM, its adoption in AEC is vulnerable to confrontation. Data interoperability is often cited as a significant barrier to BIM adoption; there is a limited focus on other dimensions of interoperability. In other research areas, such as information systems and electronic government, the evolution of interoperability construct is debated beyond data interoperability. These dimensions of interoperability have yet to be explored in the AEC industry. This research article aims to introduce the BIM Interoperability Adoption Model (BIAM). For this purpose, we investigate the interoperability in multiple dimensions according to the European Interoperability framework and develop BIM Interoperability Model with factors affecting each interoperability dimension. BIAM offers a comprehensive assessment of technical, organizational, semantic, and legal interoperability in intra –organizational AEC units, inter-organizational AEC, and BIM partner organizations and assists as a model in assessing the level of compliance and maturity interoperability. BIAM is proposed to work as a link between the organizational, semantic, legal, and technical factors to determine the interoperability issues in the early stages of BIM adoption. The BIAM model addresses interoperability factors and provides recommendations and specifications to help AEC firms to collaborate more effectively by improving interoperability activities, organizational mapping processes, and improving legal coordination. Furthermore, opportunities for future research related to BIM interoperability are discussed, and addressing these aspects of interoperability will make collaborative project delivery well informed, more structured, and effective.}

Its low usage in developing economies is of particular concern to policymakers since this technology has the potential to enable financial inclusion. In this study, in order to develop policy interventions for greater usage, we comparatively analyze factors impacting actual usage and future use intention. India, with its uneven trajectory of mobile payments, gives us an appropriate field to investigate citizens’ usage behaviour. Considering users’ perceptions of both positive and negative attributes of the technology, we develop research models under the umbrella of the valence framework. We utilize technology affordances and constraints theory (TACT) to refine the research models through an understanding of various innovative uses. To test the valence-TACT models, we collect survey responses of 551 citizens across four Indian cities. The results from the models show how certain factors, such as convenience, reflection, and security, have different impacts on actual usage and future use intention, respectively. These findings have implications for critical issues like security, risk, and digital literacy, and can help in the design of policy recommendations for enhancing the use of mobile payments, thereby impacting financial inclusion for all. The valence-TACT model provides a theoretical contribution to mobile payment and innovation literature and also offers several policy insights.}

One of the challenges of Industry 4.0 is the urgent need to lower the consumption of energy, water and raw materials, as well as to ensure the safe and reliable running of a plant and reduce maintenance costs. The work presented herein proposes the low cost integration of Energy Management Systems (EMS) and Maintenance Management Systems (MMS) within the main management systems of a company, formed by organization appliances such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Distributed Control Systems (DCS) or Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), The proposal has the virtue of introducing maintenance and energy saving in the company agenda. A central role in such integration is played by the generalized use of network analyzers in electric machinery; the information gained from these network analyzers is not only interesting for ascertaining energy consumption, but also for understanding the real operating conditions of the machinery, identifying premature failures or abnormal behavior. Dramatic reductions (about 50%) in energy consumption and required maintenance inspections, as well as the extension of piece replacement time, are achieved at a reasonable cost. The proposed measures have been implemented by a multinational corporation, owners of a chemical plant located in El Palmar (Murcia-Spain).}

AI will play an integral role in achieving this goal. This study focuses on the use of AI techniques in the energy sector. This study aims to present a realistic baseline that allows researchers and readers to compare their AI efforts, ambitions, new state-of-the-art applications, challenges, and global roles in policymaking. We covered three major aspects, including: i) the use of AI in solar and hydrogen power generation; (ii) the use of AI in supply and demand management control; and (iii) recent advances in AI technology. This study explored how AI techniques outperform traditional models in controllability, big data handling, cyberattack prevention, smart grid, IoT, robotics, energy efficiency optimization, predictive maintenance control, and computational efficiency. Big data, the development of a machine learning model, and AI will play an important role in the future energy market. Our study’s findings show that AI is becoming a key enabler of a complex, new and data-related energy industry, providing a key magic tool to increase operational performance and efficiency in an increasingly cut-throat environment. As a result, the energy industry, utilities, power system operators, and independent power producers may need to focus more on AI technologies if they want meaningful results to remain competitive. New competitors, new business strategies, and a more active approach to customers would require informed and flexible regulatory engagement with the associated complexities of customer safety, privacy, and information security.

However, despite the recent large-scale development of smart cities in China, it is still uncertain whether smart cities could effectively promote urban resilience. Exploiting the quasi-experimental nature of smart city development in China, this paper uses DID and PSM-DID to determine their impact on urban resilience. Four aspects of urban resilience are analyzed: economic resilience, social resilience, ecological resilience, and infrastructure resilience. The results show that the development of smart cities can improve social resilience considerably without any obvious effect on economic and ecological resilience and even negatively affect infrastructure resilience; the distribution effect, technological effect, and structural effect are important mechanisms for smart cities to influence urban resilience; and smart cities that have a sound industrial structure, enough good-quality companies, large size, and a large pool of highly-skilled labor are much more likely to be associated with a high level of urban resilience. Policy suggestions are also provided to promote the simultaneous improvement of smart cities and urban resilience, and hence help establish a new ‘urban resilience’ model.}

Digitalization has increased the adoption pace of Industry 4.0 technologies, particularly in connection with Open Innovation. However, companies are still finding it challenging to know the variety of Industry 4.0 technologies available, and their fit with the scope of the organization. To address this issue, a cross-sectional research design under quantitative approach was adopted. The data were collected first-hand through a survey questionnaire from a total of 238 technology companies in Malaysia.

abstract = {Many different worldwide initiatives are promoting the transformation from machine dominant manufacturing to digital manufacturing. Thus, to achieve a successful transformation to Industry 4.0 standard, manufacturing enterprises are required to implement a clear roadmap. However, Small and Medium Manufacturing Enterprises (SMEs) encounter many barriers and difficulties (economical, technical, cultural, etc.) in the implementation of Industry 4.0. Although several works deal with the incorporation of Industry 4.0 technologies in the area of the product and supply chain life cycles, which SMEs could use as reference, this is not the case for the customer life cycle. Thus, we present two contributions that can help the software engineers of those SMEs to incorporate Industry 4.0 technologies in the context of the customer life cycle. The first contribution is a methodology that can help those software engineers in the task of creating new software services, aligned with Industry 4.0, that allow to change how customers interact with enterprises and the experiences they have while interacting with them. The methodology details a set of stages that are divided into phases which in turn are made up of activities. It places special emphasis on the incorporation of semantics descriptions and 3D visualization in the implementation of those new services. The second contribution is a system developed for a real manufacturing scenario, using the proposed methodology, which allows to observe the possibilities that this kind of systems can offer to SMEs in two phases of the customer life cycle: Discover & Shop, and Use & Service.}

Indeed, the deep and rapid penetration of renewable energy-based technologies have been believed to very well fit into a smart city under various scales, this could supply a secure basis for a modern society with a low-carbon economy. In this review paper, the main components and roles of renewable energy resources (such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, ocean, and biofuels) for the smart city were fully introduced. Besides, integrating the renewable sources form into the energy systems of smart cities was thoroughly analyzed on the basis of technical and economic criteria. Finally, existing challenges and future scenarios were also discussed in detail to clarify the progress and perspective of smart renewable energy systems for the smart city. In general, the integration of renewables into energy systems of the smart city is a sagacious perspective and solution aiming to achieve cleaner process and more sustainable development. However, the optimization issues of the energy system for integrating of renewable components, ensuring good stability, maximizing the operating range, and minimizing the investment costs should be critically evaluated in the future works.}

The increased anxiety caused by the pandemic heightened the likelihood of cyber-attacks succeeding corresponding with an increase in the number and range of cyber-attacks. This paper analyses the COVID-19 pandemic from a cyber-crime perspective and highlights the range of cyber-attacks experienced globally during the pandemic. Cyber-attacks are analysed and considered within the context of key global events to reveal the modus-operandi of cyber-attack campaigns. The analysis shows how following what appeared to be large gaps between the initial outbreak of the pandemic in China and the first COVID-19 related cyber-attack, attacks steadily became much more prevalent to the point that on some days, three or four unique cyber-attacks were being reported. The analysis proceeds to utilise the UK as a case study to demonstrate how cyber-criminals leveraged salient events and governmental announcements to carefully craft and execute cyber-crime campaigns.}

To address this, we build on the Penrosean view of firm growth and the literature on high-growth firms to identify the critical growth-enabling activities of scaling firms with digital business models: financing, innovation, digitization, and acquisitions. Using cluster analysis of a sample of 184 Unicorn and emerging Unicorn scale-ups with digital business models, we identify four distinct activity configurations, or scale-up modes: network growers, focused scalers, organic innovators, and constricted scalers. We discuss the theoretical implications for the literature on scaling firms, Penrose's theory of firm growth in the digitization era, and firm growth research more generally.}

Innovation such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and blockchain is not only confined to the manufacturing industry but covers the whole of human life. Notwithstanding the said innovation, it also gives rise to cybercrimes with these technologies’ assistance. The botnet called Mirai is one example of compromising the technology in IR 4.0 to launch large-scale cyberattacks through Internet access. It is therefore crucial for the digital forensic (DF) organization to be ready to handle this kind of incident. This paper aims to provide the indicators for DF organizations’ maturity and readiness in the era of IR 4.0. To establish the indicators, a systematic literature review (SLR) is conducted. It involves four phases in the SLR, where the focus is; (1) challenges of DF in IR 4.0, (2) chain of custody and DF readiness, (3) existing maturity model, and (4) benchmarking the maturity element, respectively. It covers the research studies taken from five databases. From the comparison analysis, this study has derived five indicators for the maturity and readiness of DF organization: (1) People and capacity development, (2) Organization, policy and cooperation, (3) Process, (4) Technology and technical, (5) Legislation and regulation. Finally the work outlines the DF practices based on the CMMI ver. 2 practice areas and potential governance and management objectives that can govern the DF organization.}

This unprecedented growth calls for a systematic review of the concept, scope, definition, and functionality of Industry 4.0. Such systematic review should address the existing ambiguities and deliver a clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date overview of this phenomenon, including the possible implications for sustainability. Consistently, the present study carried out a systematic literature review of related articles, published online within the Industry 4.0 discipline until November 2020. The systematic literature review identified 745 eligible articles and applied extensive qualitative and quantitative data analysis methodically. The study provides a descriptive assessment of eligible articles’ properties and offers a unified conceptualization of Industry 4.0 and the underlying building blocks. The study explains how the implications of Industry 4.0 for value creation expand beyond the manufacturing industry. The study further describes the sustainability value drivers of the fourth industrial revolution and identifies the conditions on which digital industrial transformation success lays. Overall, findings reveal that Industry 4.0 transformation could address pressing issues of sustainable development goals, particularly concerning the manufacturing-economic development. The study also draws on the findings and offers important theoretical and practical implications, highlights the existing gaps within the literature, and discusses the possible future research directions.}

Internationalization, digitalization, and sustainability are three key growth paths for firms. In particular, the contemporary economy stresses the relevance of digital transformation as a central driver towards innovation and business renewal, especially for established small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). However, little is known about the relationships among the above-mentioned growth paths, whether they are competing or complementary options. Our contribution addresses this gap focusing on two forms of organizational readiness within SMEs. First, it investigates the impact of Artificial Intelligence readiness on international performance. Second, it explores whether the relationship between digitalization and internationalization is affected by sustainability readiness. The empirical survey relies on a sample consisting of 438 SMEs, including both domestic and international companies. Findings confirm, as expected, that Artificial Intelligence readiness positively influences the international performance of SMEs. Moreover, we find that digitalization and sustainability are positively related, but they turn to be competing growth paths when the firm internationalizes..}

Health information technology can support the development of national learning health and care systems, which can be defined as health and care systems that continuously use data-enabled infrastructure to support policy and planning, public health, and personalisation of care. The COVID-19 pandemic has offered an opportunity to assess how well equipped the UK is to leverage health information technology and apply the principles of a national learning health and care system in response to a major public health shock. With the experience acquired during the pandemic, each country within the UK should now re-evaluate their digital health and care strategies. After leaving the EU, UK countries now need to decide to what extent they wish to engage with European efforts to promote interoperability between electronic health records. Major priorities for strengthening health information technology in the UK include achieving the optimal balance between top-down and bottom-up implementation, improving usability and interoperability, developing capacity for handling, processing, and analysing data, addressing privacy and security concerns, and encouraging digital inclusivity. Current and future opportunities include integrating electronic health records across health and care providers, investing in health data science research, generating real-world data, developing artificial intelligence and robotics, and facilitating public–private partnerships. Many ethical challenges and unintended consequences of implementation of health information technology exist. To address these, there is a need to develop regulatory frameworks for the development, management, and procurement of artificial intelligence and health information technology systems, create public–private partnerships, and ethically and safely apply artificial intelligence in the National Health Service.}

Industry 4.0 was introduced in 2011 and since then has been perceived in multiple ways such as a vision, a paradigm, a scenario or as a digital revolution in production and service organizations. Even though Industry 4.0 is associated with great improvements for companies, there is still a lack of a uniform definition of the term Industry 4.0, especially when it comes to the transfer of knowledge from theoretical research to the implementation in organizations, which leads to confusion and disaffirmation. The lack of a clear structure and a holistic definition of the research topic Industry 4.0 inhibits the development of new business areas and new research approaches. To target this fundamental gap, a methodology is developed and the 338 most relevant publications are analyzed in the database of ScienceDirect starting from 2015. Based on those publications, the field of Industry 4.0 is structured. A consistent and comprehensive definition for Industry 4.0 is introduced by using a bibliometric analysis. Therefore, existing descriptions are decomposed into word fragments and analyzed. It is shown that this novel approach to find a definition for the term “Industry 4.0” does not yet exist. The aim is to provide a purely objective definition based on a statistical evaluation, without restricting the selection of publications to a specific research or business area. Based on those data, a new and ubiquitous definition of Industry 4.0 is formed, discussed and validated on practical examples.}

abstract = {Wood-based solutions are promoted for sustainable construction. In parallel, technological applications are expected to elevate construction and built environment to a new level of energy and resource efficiency, and enhance the environmental as well as human health and wellbeing impacts by smart bundling of products and services. Policies call for a profound system change in construction. Such shift necessitates technological and non-technological innovations as well as new conceptualizations. This research elaborates an analytic framework to discuss system change in the complex product systems of construction. Wood-based solutions are assessed vis-à-vis other sustainable construction projects to detect service innovation as new outputs, inputs, and processes in the markets, and consider the system change potential in evolving product-service systems (PSS). Analyses of eight projects and altogether 89 companies in Finland indicate that while wood-based solutions aim at industrial efficiency in the established construction processes, parallel sustainable construction projects and the contributing companies exemplify more versatile service innovations. The industrial efficiency unfolding from the sustainable construction niches and the company operations in the markets illustrates evolving PSS. The data exemplifies how the increasing integration leads into dismantling of operations and new configurations of tasks, and the increasing standardization due to fine-granule modularity and customization leads to increasing diversification of operations. Alternative scenarios should be explored to assess the systemic changes and their impacts on clean technology solutions.}

This systematic review maps out four technological risks and five ethical issues in the deployment of robotics and autonomous systems in long-term care. Safety, privacy, liability, and adverse employment consequences to the existing nursing care workers were identified as major technological risks; while loss of autonomy, loss of human interaction and social connectedness, objectification and infantilisation, deception and social justice were identified as five major ethical issues related to the deployment of robotics and autonomous systems in long-term care. This review also identified antagonistic interactions between some of the technological risks and ethical issues that could offset each other. Findings from the review have implications for advancing knowledge on the governance of robotics in long-term care. Policy formulations and implementations would need to account for intricate issues that could arise from technological risks, ethical issues and their paradoxical interactions.}

Digital technologies are reshaping how the interactions between the living and the dead are negotiated. Indeed, emerging technologies are not only embedded in end-of-life, death, and grief experiences, they are also changing the global context in which these phenomena take place. Although interactions between death-related phenomena and technologies are not new, the ubiquitous presence of digitalized spaces drastically increased the salience and the magnitude of these interactions. To further and structure the understanding of these interactions, we introduce the concept of cyberthanatology as the articulation of death and all related phenomena with and within the digital space. In the light of this framing concept, this paper explores the topology of online death-related behaviors and phenomena, reviews the current state of knowledge on the online representation of death and grief, and identifies the challenges that will have to be faced in the future in order to optimally integrate the understanding of death-related phenomena in the larger field of cyberpsychology. By promoting and nurturing the dialog between the fields of cyberpsychology and death studies, cyberthanatology research will not only result in theoretical advances but also contribute to generate practical knowledge to help people deal with death and grief in the modern technological age.}

abstract = {The real estate sector brings a fortune to the global economy. But, presently, this sector is regressive and uses traditional methods and approaches. Therefore, it needs a technological transformation and innovation in line with the Industry 4.0 requirements to transform into smart real estate. However, it faces the barriers of disruptive digital technology (DDT) adoption and innovation that need effective management to enable such transformation. These barriers present managerial challenges that affect DDT adoption and innovation in smart real estate. The current study assesses these DDTs adoption and innovation barriers facing the Australian real estate sector from a managerial perspective. Based on a comprehensive review of 72 systematically retrieved and shortlisted articles, we identify 21 key barriers to digitalisation and innovation. The barriers are grouped into the technology-organisation-external environment (TOE) categories using a Fault tree. Data is collected from 102 real estate and property managers to rate and rank the identified barriers. The results show that most of the respondents are aware of the DDTs and reported AI (22.5% of respondents), big data (12.75%) and VR (12.75%) as the most critical technologies not adopted so far due to costs, organisation policies, awareness, reluctance, user demand, tech integration, government support and funding. Overall, the highest barrier (risk) scores are observed for high costs of software and hardware (T1), high complexity of the selected technology dissemination system (T2) and lack of government incentives, R&D support, policies, regulations and standards (E1). Among the TOE categories, as evident from the fault tree analysis, the highest percentage of failure to adopt the DDT is attributed to E1 in the environmental group. For the technological group, the highest failure reason is attributed to T2. And for the organisational group, the barrier with the highest failure chances for DDT adoption is the lack of organisational willingness to invest in digital marketing (O4). These barriers must be addressed to pave the way for DDT adoption and innovation in the Australian real estate sector and move towards smart real estate.}

Among the hot research topics, Fintech is leading the trend in terms of the newest technology applications. The relatively new emerging paradigms in various sciences, such as geometry (fractals), physics (quantum), and database systems (distributed ledger—blockchain), seem to potentially contribute to a greater shift in the framework of the finance industry, bringing also some concerns (cyber-threats). Consistent and extensive investigation of the reasonable potential impact of these new models (and their underlying technologies) is performed, and then tested through a SWOT analysis, as the main objective of this research. Threats and opportunities are always intrinsically driven by the introduction of technological advancements (revolutions). This research confirms that information availability and the increasing interconnection of crosswise applications of each discovery to the different fields of science is determining the rapid succession of revolutions identified by evident large shifts in economic paradigms. The growing computing capacity and the development of increasingly powerful predictive software are leading to a competitive, extremely dynamic, and challenging system. In this context, as shown by history, there is a high possibility of market concentration in which, however, only a few corporations—digital giants—can afford to develop these technologies, consolidating their dominance.}

abstract = {This paper addresses the interplay between robots, cybersecurity, and safety from a European legal perspective, a topic under-explored by current technical and legal literature. The legal framework, together with technical standards, is a necessary parameter for the production and deployment of robots. However, European law does not regulate robots as such, and there exist multiple and overlapping legal requirements focusing on specific contexts, such as product safety and medical devices. Besides, the recently enacted European Cybersecurity Act establishes a cybersecurity certification framework, which could be used to define cybersecurity requirements for robots, although concrete cyber-physical implementation requirements are not yet prescribed. In this article, we illustrate cybersecurity challenges and their subsequent safety implications with the concrete example of care robots. These robots interact in close, direct contact with children, elderly, and persons with disabilities, and a malfunctioning or cybersecurity threat may affect the health and well-being of these people. Moreover, care robots may process vast amounts of data, including health and behavioral data, which are especially sensitive in the healthcare domain. Security vulnerabilities in robots thus raise significant concerns, not only for manufacturers and programmers, but also for those who interact with them, especially in sensitive applications such as healthcare. While the latest European policymaking efforts on robot regulation acknowledge the importance of cybersecurity, many details, and their impact on user safety have not yet been addressed in depth. Our contribution aims to answer the question whether the current European legal framework is prepared to address cyber and physical risks from care robots and ensure safe human–robot interactions in such a sensitive context. Cybersecurity and physical product safety legal requirements are governed separately in a dual regulatory framework, presenting a challenge in governing uniformly and adequately cyber-physical systems such as care robots. We conceptualize and discuss the challenges of regulating cyber-physical systems’ security with the current dual framework, particularly the lack of mandatory certifications. We conclude that policymakers need to consider cybersecurity as an indissociable aspect of safety to ensure robots are truly safe to use.}

However, the data access is carried out through an open channel and battery operated drones. Therefore, the drones’ security and privacy are crucial for accomplishing mission-critical, safety-critical, or surveillance operations. In 2020, Bera et al. presented a certificate based access control scheme for securing the IoD access and argued the scheme’s security through formal and informal methods. However, the analysis presented in this paper shows that the scheme of Bera et al. does not provide anonymity and is insecure against multiple threats, including drone impersonation, the man in the middle, and replay attacks. We then designed a generic certificate based access control scheme to provide inter-drone and drone to ground station access control/authentication in the IoD domain (GCACS-IoD). The GCACS-IoD is provably secure against the known attacks and provides anonymity. GCACS-IoD extends security while preserving computation and communication efficiencies.}

This growing importance is due to the need for policymakers, urban managers, port authorities, local administrators, shipping companies, couriers, and so on to develop increasingly digitalized and sustainable logistic processes. Therefore, in a global context characterized by intense datafication and globalization of trade, the data-based approach has become a necessary modus operandi to promote smart and sustainable logistics development. This forward-looking model of port logistics uses technologies such as IoT, sensors, cloud computing platforms, Big Data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), GPS tracking systems, radars, drones, real-time monitoring stations, smart grids, and so on in order to collect, process, monitor and analyse data and information concerning the economic, environmental, social and technological sphere of port cities. In this sense, mobile and fixed platforms help logistics operators to optimize the management of flows (e.g., water, waste, emissions, raw materials, people, monetary investments, etc.) in an efficient and digitized manner. The study proposes a systematic literature review of the most recurring themes concerning smart and sustainable logistics initiatives within port cities in order to develop a multidimensional framework capable of holistically integrating the prevailing enabling factors (Ecosystem, Internal Organization, Data and Security, Policy and Regulation, Finance and Funding, and Digital and Technology), domains (Mobility, Environment, Economy, Telecommunications, Safety and Security, Government, and Community) and goals (Sustainable Development and Digitalization) that characterize smart and sustainable logistical development. To this end, the best practices of several pioneering port cities such as Rotterdam, Hamburg, Singapore, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, etc. implemented in partnerships with technology companies such as Cisco, IBM, Huawei and SAP were also analysed. Therefore, the results of this research show that smart and sustainable logistics initiatives in port cities: (a) have the potential to enhance the efficiency of the economic, environmental, social and technological flows; (b) increase the involvement and awareness of stakeholders such as couriers, shippers, shipping companies, citizens, port authorities, municipalities, security officers, gate and terminal personnel, and so on; and (c) provide a detailed overview of the enabling factors, domains and goals that must be activated by port cities to foster a smart and sustainable logistic transition.}

abstract = {Introduction
Internationally the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a dramatic and unprecedented shift in telehealth uptake as a means of protecting healthcare consumers and providers through remote consultation modes. Early in the pandemic, Australia implemented a comprehensive and responsive set of policy measures to support telehealth. Initially targeted at protecting vulnerable individuals, including health professionals, this rapidly expanded to a “whole population” approach as the pandemic evolved. This policy response supported health system capacity and community confidence by protecting patients and healthcare providers; creating opportunities for controlled triage, remote assessment and treatment of mild COVID-19 cases; redeploying quarantined or isolated health care workers (HCWs); and maintaining routine and non-COVID healthcare.
Purpose
This paper provides a review of the literature regarding telephone and video consulting, outlines the pre-COVID background to telehealth implementation in Australia, and describes the national telehealth policy measures instituted in response to COVID-19. Aligned with the existing payment system for out of hospital care, and funded by the national health insurance scheme, a suite of approximately 300 temporary telehealth Medicare-subsidised services were introduced. Response to these initiatives was swift and strong, with 30.01 million services, at a cost of AUD $1.54 billion, claimed in the first six months.
Findings
This initiative has been a major policy success, ensuring the safety of healthcare consumers and healthcare workers during a time of great uncertainty, and addressing known financial risks and barriers for health service providers. The risks posed by COVID-19 have radically altered the value proposition of telehealth for patients and clinicians, overcoming many previously encountered barriers to implementation, including willingness of clinicians to adopt telehealth, consumer awareness and demand, and the necessity of learning new ways of conducting safe consultations. However, ensuring the quality of telehealth services is a key ongoing concern.
Conclusions
Despite a preference by policymakers for video consultation, the majority of telehealth consults in Australia were conducted by telephone. The pronounced dominance of telephone item numbers in early utilisation data suggests there are still barriers to video-consultations, and a number of challenges remain before the well-described benefits of telehealth can be fully realised from this policy and investment. Ongoing exposure to a range of clinical, legislative, insurance, educational, regulatory, and interoperability concerns and solutions, driven by necessity, may drive changes in expectations about what is desirable and feasible – among both patients and clinicians.}

The Cybersecurity Judgment Questionnaire was developed and administered to assess intuitive and rational judgments of cybersecurity risks. Two major findings of the study include: (1) three significant risk factors associated with both intuitive and rational cybersecurity judgment were Age Group, Region, and Prior GenCyber Camp Experience. That is, younger students, the campers from the West region, and participants attending the camps before tended to have a lower level of cybersecurity judgment; and (2) two significant protective factors were Cyber Use Length and Current GenCyber Camp Experience, i.e., the experiences of both using computers, Internet, cellphones and participating in the current camps having significant advantages in judging cybersecurity risks intuitively and rationally. Thus, it is critical to use both the push strategy to minimize the risk factors and the pull strategy to maximize the protective factors. It is concluded with a summary of limitations and future studies, i.e., replicating the findings in regular K-12 schools, examining more risk and protective factors, conducting longitudinal studies, and studying underlying mechanisms.}

The outcomes of the enforced and large-scale work from home (WFH) practices are currently largely unexplored. This study aims to address this gap in the research by investigating the external and internal digital knowledge sharing (DKS) and creative performance (CP) of employees under these extraordinary circumstances. The social capital theory was utilized as the theoretical lens for examining the associations of DKS and CP with demographic, individual, and organizational factors. An online cross-sectional survey was carried out among knowledge workers based in Norway during the pandemic lockdown. The study results indicate that internal and external DKS are significant predictors of CP in the WFH context during the COVID-19 pandemic. Females and older employees are more likely to engage in external DKS than their counterparts. Furthermore, individual motivation is found to be positively associated with internal DKS, external DKS, and CP. The findings suggest that increased use of digital platforms helps increase CP in the WFH setting resulting from the pandemic. Various theoretical and practical implications are discussed, and future research avenues are proposed.}

We bring together contributions from leading anthropologists, technologists, political scientists, legal and communication scholars exploring how norms underpin the new ordering of the internet, whether in explicit or implicit forms. Through various theoretical lenses, contributions analyze the impact of platforms, states, civil society, expert groups and key individuals on restructuring the normative order of the internet, and present empirical evidence for instances of norm creation, legitimation, contestation and opposition. Valuable new insights for norm development processes come from case studies, ethnographies, legal and discourse analysis and interdisciplinary approaches locating agency and power plays. In this introduction, we define the key concepts applicable to norm entrepreneurship and discuss their interplay in internet governance debates, followed by an overview of the articles included in the special issue. In the final section, we reflect on the implications of our new research agenda.}

Optimizing the cargo flows through the nodes of a digital transport corridor is a crucial problem; solving it allows to introduce modern management methods in logistics. This study examines the optimization of the technology of a distribution center as the base node of a third-party logistics network operator. Our objective consisted in theoretically substantiating the application of mathematical formalisms to describing the passage of stochastic goods flows of a complex structure through a node of a logistics network. To solve the problem, we constructed a mathematical model intended as a decision-making block in the Warehouse Management System software. This paper presents the results of calculations carried out using a computer according to the proposed algorithm. Preliminary results allow to conclude that there is a significant resource for reducing construction and maintenance costs of the distribution center. Quantitatively, the savings will range from 10% to 40%, depending on the terms of delivery of goods and the degree of market uncertainty. An example of a practical calculation using the developed mathematical model is given. The calculations were performed for Huawei, a key global provider of ICT infrastructure and smart terminals. The algorithms were designed to account for uncertainty, which allows to use the results for risk management applications. In practice, this theoretical concept can serve as a basis for digital logistics platforms, increasing the speed of delivery of goods and cargo and the profitability of logistics as a result. The solution to this problem will allow to consider the nodes of logistics networks as smart independent divisions with an information interface for interaction built into a digital logistics platform. The role of these nodes is to make the best decisions in handling cargo flows. As the next stage of research, we plan to develop algorithms for coordinating the information flows reflecting transport activities and forming the material flows entering and leaving the distribution centers.}

This study explores how these factors contribute to the performance of KIBS, with performance here measured in terms of future financial performance. The analysis was conducted using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The study shows that updating social networks, using social networks for corporate purposes, having a high level of training in digital tools, and having older managers can enhance company performance.}

Smart city mission has influenced the citizen’s life with respect to the automation on fundamental needs. Energy resources are considered as one of the important requirements for the survival of people. With the advent of Internet of Things, smart grid systems are designed in order to meet the sustainable demands. It also provides information about the energy resources consumed and alert the consumers about the demand prevails on the resources. Technological improvement is more essential for a country, only if it can be considered and adaptable for sustainable development. Therefore these papers outline the Internet of Things based smart grid which helps in the energy conservation process to meet the future demands. Energy management processes has to be well-versed among the citizens as it helps in understanding the possible ways on storage of energy resources. However, when energy storage is concerned, security issues are the counterpart which has to be focused at higher level. Therefore, blockchain techniques applied for energy storage systems are also outlined along with the applications and future directions of smart grid.}

It may be seen as a manifestation of technological progression which has been traditionally given a strong emphasis in theories of economic growth. The roots of digitalization are thus old, but the terminology has experienced rapid growth during the last decades. This paper focuses on the future prospects of digitalization in Finnish ports operating international trade and transports. In the case of transport, logistics, and ports the public sector has, mainly through ministries and offices focusing on economic development and employment, initiated numerous development programs with foresight ambitions. Commonly, these programs have a mid-range target setting referring to a 5–10-years time span into the future. The primary data is collected from two workshops (group interviews). As a result, the research identifies the main drivers and technologies that are significant for port digitalization. These are discussed in the context of three alternative scenarios: Digital supremacy; business as usual; and digital failure. These three scenarios are classified with SWOT (Strengths; Weaknesses; Opportunities; Threats) and PESTEL (Political; Economic; Social; Technological; Environmental; Legal) frameworks. It is assumed that the actualized future development will follow the mid-sections of the scenarios depending on global trends in politics and trade that impact the supply and demand that underlie the need for transport.}

While the proliferation of hacking technology for government actors has led to various proposed solutions for accountability, little consideration has been given to public purchasing of this technology. This article explores whether public contracting processes could be used to help minimize the risks that arise from the use of government hacking technology, and, if so, the types of contractual clauses and institutional supports that might be useful to achieve that goal. In exploring this issue, this article considers theories of government by contract and the publicization of the private sector. These theories posit that public contracting can be used as a vehicle to impose public considerations—for example, certain policy goals—on the private sector. It argues that requirements of transparency and accountability that inhere on the public sector could be transferred in part to the private sector through the vehicle of a public contract and explores how public contracts for government hacking technology could be structured in order to reduce risks posed by the use of this technology.}
