abstract = {The Peep attack is a variant application of a Botnet. This paper proposes a forensic procedure to analyze the attack behavior and explains how to carry out a computer crime investigation. We also discuss the well-known Botnets engaged in the execution of a Peep attack. In our paper, we describe a Peep attack on the Internet as the paradigm of how a cyber-investigator needs to act in the case of a Cybercrime. When cyber detectives prepare to investigate a break in cyber security, there are some issues they must keep in mind and face up to. It is crucial to swiftly preserve digital evidence and conduct forensic analysis that any useful evidence is seized soon after the cybercrime has been committed. Furthermore, there are two phases of digital forensic analysis to retrieve useful evidence when facing a cybercrime attack in our scheme. One phase observes the Internet attack action, and the other one introduces how to investigate each case in on-line analysis of sniffing packets and off-line examination of abnormal files. We believe that this analysis model is workable for any other form of Botnets presently being used.}

The rapid pace of change in instrumentation and control (I&C) technology, pressures to improve plant efficiency and maximize safety, and the increasing age of existing NPPs are highlighting the challenges of ageing in key I&C components such as pressure transmitters, temperature sensors, neutron detectors, and cables. Online monitoring (OLM) techniques enable plants to monitor the ageing of their installed I&C while the plant is operating. OLM techniques include low-and high-frequency methods that use existing sensors, such as noise analysis; methods based on test or diagnostic sensors; and methods based on active measurements made by injecting a test signal into sensors.}

The growing role of cyberspace in society has opened up new threats as well as new opportunities. A growing number of ­adversaries are looking to use cyberspace to steal, compromise, or destroy critical data, and the national security machinery of governments have no choice but to find ways to confront and overcome these threats if they are to flourish in an increasingly competitive and globalized world. As citizens put more of their lives online, this matters more and more. People want to be confident that the networks that support our national security, our prosperity, and our own private lives as individuals are safe and resilient. The scale of our dependence now means that our economic well–being, our key infrastructure, our places of work, and our homes can all be directly affected. With the increase in unlawful and illegitimate activity in cyberspace a dedicated strategic response is required by governments to counter all types of cyber–related threats—a response that continues to present the greatest contemporary challenge to national security policy and practice. In this chapter, the diverse range of cyber threats is explored alongside the countermeasures employed by governments to protect their citizens. Examined from a national security practitioner's perspective the scale of the cyber security challenge is acknowledged as requiring strong national leadership, but examines how governments can no longer act alone and must seek out new partnerships in a collaborative response to ensure that they are better prepared today to meet the cyber security challenges of tomorrow.}

However, secure software development environment have often been ignored in the nuclear industry. In response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) revised the Regulatory Guide (RG 1.152-2006) “Criteria for use of computers in safety systems of nuclear power plants” to provide specific security guidance throughout the software development life cycle. Software Configuration Management (SCM) is an essential discipline in the software development environment. SCM involves identifying configuration items, controlling changes to those items, and maintaining integrity and traceability of them. For securing the nuclear safety software, this paper proposes a Secure SCM Processes (S2CMP) which infuses regulatory security requirements into proposed SCM processes. Furthermore, a Process Flow Diagram (PFD) is adopted to describe S2CMP, which is intended to enhance the communication between regulators and developers.}

The purpose of this study is to provide insight into challenges and create a prospectus by offering a socio-technical analysis of broadband development. This will involve the in-depth investigation of the social dynamics, political discourse, and technological choices inherent in the design and development of the next generation of networks. Despite active investment and proactive drive, uncertainty still remains surrounding the evolution of broadband and what impact it may have on the new broadband milieu in Korea. This study will offer an effective adoption/diffusion strategy as well as a viable information policy model for more advanced infrastructure in other countries.}

Today's end-to-end power and energy systems (from fuel source to end use) fundamentally depend on embedded and often an overlaid systems of sensors, computation, communication, control and optimization. There are even more opportunities and challenges in today's devices and systems, as well as in the emerging modern power systems – ranging from dollars, watts, emissions, standards, and more – at nearly every scale of sensing and control. Recent policies combined with potential for technological innovations and business opportunities, have attracted a high level of interest in smart grids. The potential for a highly distributed system with a high penetration of intermittent sources poses opportunities and challenges. Any complex dynamic infrastructure network typically has many layers, decision-making units and is vulnerable to various types of disturbances. Effective, intelligent, distributed control is required that would enable parts of the networks to remain operational and even automatically reconfigure in the event of local failures or threats of failure. This presentation provides an overview of smart grids and recent advances in distributed sensing, modeling, and control, particularly at both the high-voltage power grid and at consumer level. Such advances may contribute toward the development of an effective, intelligent, distributed control of power system networks with a focus on addressing distributed sensing, computation, estimation, controls and dynamical systems challenges and opportunities ahead.}

We found that countries across the world differ in terms of regulative, normative and cognitive legitimacy to different types of web attacks. Cyber wars and crimes are also functions of the stocks of hacking skills relative to the availability of economic opportunities. An attacking unit's selection criteria for the target network include symbolic significance and criticalness, degree of digitization of values and weakness in defense mechanisms.

Trust, or the lack of it, has also been identified by the European Commission’s Digital Agenda as a major barrier to further development of the information society in Europe. One of the areas in which concerns have been raised is in relation to children’s safety online. As a result, substantial efforts have been made by policymakers and by the industry to build greater trust and confidence in online digital safety. This paper examines what trust means in the context of children’s use of the Internet. Should policy on trust enhancement, for instance, include children’s own trust in the technologies or services they use or is it sufficient to seek to reinforce parental and adult confidence that children can be adequately protected? What is required to build that trust from either perspective? Does it need, or should it include a relationship of trust between parents and children? To tease out these questions further, the paper examines current European Union policy frameworks on digital safety, particularly industry responses to the call for a more trusted Internet environment for children, and argues that technical solutions to be effective need to carefully balance a number of competing objectives and to be sufficiently grounded in evidence of parental and child experience of the Internet.}
