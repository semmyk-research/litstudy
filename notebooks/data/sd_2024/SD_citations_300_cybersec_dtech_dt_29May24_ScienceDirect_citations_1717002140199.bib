abstract = {Robots guided by artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming service operations in for-profit companies. However, public and non-profit organizations have been slower to pursue these innovative new technologies. We conducted an in-depth single-case qualitative study of one public organization (a public library in Australia) to better understand the unintended consequences of humanoid service robots. Our findings theorize unintended consequences through dimensions of customer value and service interaction locus, yielding four types – service disparities, judgment-free communication, noise pollution and social touch. Our analysis reveals new insights into: 1) the unintended consequences of humanoid robots for customers; 2) the effects of these consequences on the service organization; and 3) the technology capabilities of humanoid robots as potential sources of the consequences. When public and non-profit organizations leverage these unintended consequences, they can use robots more effectively to improve the overall customer service experience.}

Such intelligent systems that could easily detect both existing and zero-day attacks are highly sought in the complex and fast evolving cyberspace. In this regard, machine learning as well as deep learning models have been very effective. However, there is the need for better performing models than the existing ones. This work is aimed at the design and implementation of a Deep Neural Network model for detecting intrusions in computer networks. Techniques such as SMOTE and Random Sampling were applied to handle data imbalance in the CICIDS 2017 dataset. The entire experiment was carried out on a single Jupyter notebook in the Google Colaboratory environment where relevant software libraries such as seaborn, pandas, matplotlib, keras, and Tensor Flow were imported and thereafter implemented as required. Performance metrics of accuracy and loss at both training and validation of the model were considered. Results show that the deep learning model was excellent at predicting attacks with the CICIDS 2017 dataset, achieving accuracy score of 99.68 % and loss of 0.0102.}

The aim is to present a dependable framework for managing large-scale energy, applicable to both isolated and network-connected modes of renewable hybrid microgrids (HMGs). This framework employs a novel adaptation of Cultural Algorithms (CA) with a two-step modification to minimize the operational expenses of the network. Additionally, it incorporates an innovative intrusion detection system (IDS) based on a deep learning model. The IDS is designed to identify cyber threats related to identity, such as Sybil attacks and masquerading attacks, within the cyber layer. The proposed IDS utilizes the real-time data gathered from the digital twin of the HMG and then uses the LSTM model to differentiate between various signal sources and identify instances of cyberattacks. The data transaction security over the messaging is first preserved by the blockchain technology and later is assessed by the proposed IDS system. To assess the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed framework, a real-time hybrid microgrid is simulated partly in physical layer and partly by digital twin of renewable units to check the model performance.}

A deeper comprehension of the metaverse ecosystem is crucial to facilitate long-term planning and the dynamic adaptation of business models in the closely related e-commerce sector. Consequently, the main objective of this paper is to explore how the metaverse impacts e-commerce business models. A two-round Delphi-based scenario study (time horizon 2035) was conducted with 26 participating experts to achieve the objective. Based on the expert responses, twenty projections were clustered into three possible future scenarios: (1) immersive and emotional commerce, (2) altered digital landscape, and (3) game changer. The scenarios indicate that the metaverse development will strongly influence e-commerce business models at the customer interface and core strategy. New business models will emerge, and existing business models will adopt the metaverse as an additional channel. As purely digital products gain increased importance, the digital landscape will be altered to fulfill new customer requests. Although improbable by 2035, the game-changing scenario entails a complete transition to digital products and the replacement of present e-commerce with metaverse commerce.}

This study conducted a systematic literature mapping of the mechanisms for measuring Internet of Things technology maturity in enterprises and organizations. A systematic search was executed in six databases, which yielded 1181 studies. Applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 78 primary studies were selected for analysis to address the research questions and perform a bibliometric analysis. The primary outcome of this research revolves around the existence of multiple mechanisms used to measure the technological maturity of the Internet of Things, including maturity models and frameworks. However, there currently needs to be standardized methods to accomplish this task. The P2668/D5 standard can serve as a reference for criteria, scales, and dimensions. Another significant result refers to the evolving nature of this field, with Germany, India, and China emerging as the main contributors to its progress. Finally, the main challenges and associated problems revolve around the absence of standardization, limited accessibility, and lack of specificity of measurement tools.}

abstract = {Information and communication technologies enable the transformation of traditional energy systems into cyber-physical energy systems (CPESs), but such systems have also become popular targets of cyberattacks. Currently, available methods for evaluating the impacts of cyberattacks suffer from limited resilience, efficacy, and practical value. To mitigate their potentially disastrous consequences, this study suggests a two-stage, discrepancy-based optimization approach that considers both preparatory actions and response measures, integrating concepts from social computing. The proposed Kullback-Leibler divergence-based, distributionally robust optimization (KDR) method has a hierarchical, two-stage objective function that incorporates the operating costs of both system infrastructures (e.g., energy resources, reserve capacity) and real-time response measures (e.g., load shedding, demand-side management, electric vehicle charging station management). By incorporating social computing principles, the optimization framework can also capture the social behavior and interactions of energy consumers in response to cyberattacks. The preparatory stage entails day-ahead operational decisions, leveraging insights from social computing to model and predict the behaviors of individuals and communities affected by potential cyberattacks. The mitigation stage generates responses designed to contain the consequences of the attack by directing and optimizing energy use from the demand side, taking into account the social context and preferences of energy consumers, to ensure resilient, economically efficient CPES operations. Our method can determine optimal schemes in both stages, accounting for the social dimensions of the problem. An original disaster mitigation model uses an abstract formulation to develop a risk-neutral model that characterizes cyberattacks through KDR, incorporating social computing techniques to enhance the understanding and response to cyber threats. This approach can mitigate the impacts more effectively than several existing methods, even with limited data availability. To extend this risk-neutral model, we incorporate conditional value at risk as an essential risk measure, capturing the uncertainty and diverse impact scenarios arising from social computing factors. The empirical results affirm that the KDR method, which is enriched with social computing considerations, produces resilient, economically efficient solutions for managing the impacts of cyberattacks on a CPES. By integrating social computing principles into the optimization framework, it becomes possible to better anticipate and address the social and behavioral aspects associated with cyberattacks on CPESs, ultimately improving the overall resilience and effectiveness of the system's response measures.}

Healthcare-based Internet of Things (Healthcare-IoT) is a turning point in the development of health information systems. This emerging trend significantly contributes to enhancing users' awareness of their health, ultimately leading to an extension in life expectancy. Security and privacy are among the greatest challenges for H-IoT systems. To establish complete safety and security in these systems, the implementation of mandatory security requirements is imperative. For this reason, this study identifies the necessary security requirements for H-IoT systems using a Meta-Synthesis approach.
Methods
Initially, following the Seven-Stage Sandelowski & Barroso approach, the existing literature was searched in the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Among the 844 extracted articles from the period of 2010 to 2020, 78 final articles were reviewed and analyzed, leading to the identification of 51 security requirements. Subsequently, to assess the quality of the identified requirements and their overlap, interviews were conducted with two experts.
Results
Finally, 14 security requirements, predominantly with technical and quantitative aspects, were identified for designing a Healthcare-IoT system and implementing security mechanisms.
Conclusion
The findings of this study emphasize that addressing the identified 14 security requirements is crucial for safeguarding Healthcare-IoT systems and ensuring their robustness in the evolving health information landscape.}

Following an analysis of a sample of 167 blockchain-oriented projects in the public sector, we explore in this article the extent of the effects of blockchain on fundamental public governance functions, and we further explore the information technology and strategic management literature in this regard. As a result, our study shows concrete evidence of how blockchain improves several government core functions: (1) public service governance, administrative efficiency, and open government capabilities; (2) process innovation in public services; and operational and administrative performance improvement. Via a fsQCA analysis, we explored how indicators characterizing blockchain-based transformation projects in the public sector led to radical transformations in public services.

This study employs neo-institutional and organisational learning theories to examine how organisations learn from incidents and gain insights into the challenges they face. Drawing on qualitative research methods, interviews were conducted with 34 security practitioners from organisations operating in the UK spanning a range of industries. The findings highlight the importance of consciously evaluating learning practices and creating a culture of openness to hear about incidents from employees, customers and suppliers. Deciding which incidents to learn from, as well as who should participate in the learning process, emerged as critical considerations. Overcoming defensiveness and addressing systemic causes were recognised as barriers to effective learning. The study emphasises the need to assess the value and impact of identified lessons and to avoid superficial reviews that treat symptoms rather than underlying causes to improve resilience. While progress has been made in learning from incidents, further enhancements are needed. Practical recommendations have been proposed to suggest how organisations may gain valuable insights for maximising the benefits derived from incident learning. This research contributes to the existing knowledge on organisational learning and informs future studies exploring the social and political influences on the learning process. By considering the suggested recommendations, organisations may strengthen their cyber security, foster a culture of continuous improvement, and respond effectively to the dynamic cyber security landscape.}

The global mobility network is an appropriate contender to be adopted as a communication platform to offer roaming services for swift data exchange and fast movement of mobile users in smart mobility. Nevertheless, the confidentiality and secrecy of the exchanged messages have become major concerns due to the insecure nature of the public communication channel. Additionally, it is worth monitoring that enhanced security measures must not increase the burden on limited-powered, small computationally efficient mobile devices. To fulfill these purposes, multiple authentication and key agreement protocols in the context of roaming services have been proposed in recent days. This research demonstrates that most of the previous authentication schemes for the GLOMONET environment have failed to achieve the aforesaid secrecy goals. To satisfy the purposes, this article has proposed a mutual authentication and session key negotiation scheme for roaming services that resists all security susceptibilities and provides essential requirements like anonymity with minimized computation and communication overhead. To support our claim, the security of the proposed scheme is formally verified using the well-known random oracle model and aProVerif simulation tool. Moreover, the implementation of the protocol using the broadly acknowledged NS-2 simulation tool visualizes the practical efficiency of the protocol.}

To facilitate such employer appeals, this study seeks a clearer understanding of why Gen Z prefers hybrid work. By analyzing key factors related to infrastructure, amenities, services, social engagement, flexibility, and remote work advantages, the current research sheds new light on the drivers of this inclination and its implications for the contemporary workplace. Notably, the results clarify that the relative influence of each factor depends not on demographics but rather on the type of work environment that Gen Zers seekw to join: a corporate setting, a family business, or an entrepreneurial venture.

Drawing on resource dependence theory (RDT), we investigated how the degree of dependence of focal firms on suppliers and customers affects their CE performance. In addition, the study proposes digitization capability as a boundary condition for these relationships, given that the literature has repeatedly highlighted the critical role of digitization capability in supply chain relationship management. Employing hierarchical linear modeling on a panel dataset of listed Chinese manufacturers during 2010–2020, we found that the more dependent a firm is on its major suppliers and customers (the higher the supplier and customer concentrations), the worse its CE performance. In addition, we utilized data mining techniques to capture manufacturers' digitalization capabilities. We examined how digitalization empowers manufacturers to alleviate power imbalances in supply chain dependencies. Our results suggest that the manufacturers’ digitalization capability significantly weakens the negative impacts of supplier and customer concentrations on CE performance. Overall, this study contributes to the RDT and relationship management literature by highlighting the dark side of supplier and customer concentrations and introducing digitalization capability as a strategic response. These findings provide practical implications for managing the supplier and customer base in pursuing CE performance.}

The digital economy is built on hyper connectivity, the growing interconnectedness of individuals, organisations, and machines due to the Internet, mobile technologies, and the IoT. Industry 4.0 technologies are automation, data exchange, cloud computing, robotics, big data, AI, the IoT, and other technological trends are all part of the industrial sector’s digital transformation, which aims to achieve industrial objectives and intelligent manufacturing practices that engage with customers, emerging technologies, and innovation. The economy is becoming more digital, changing how products and services are provided and consumed. A new road map is being provided by Industry 4.0 services to help many industries adapt their conventional methods and support the new revolution. In the digital economy, scaled-up, integrated ecosystems that leverage software platforms to generate value, build resilience, and stimulate innovation via networked goods, assets, people, and processes rapidly replace old, linear value chains with partner participation.}

Through semi-structured, in-depth interviews, the experiences and observations of 112 company leaders representing nine different industries in Vietnam were gathered. The analysis first reveals that Industry 4.0 involvement has internal and external knowledge-based ramifications, including more productivity and enhanced communication. Second, organisational knowledge is based on proactiveness and reaching within/out, predominantly through training, organisational support, and external experts. Third, organisational knowledge supports Industry 4.0 implementation primarily by taking charge internally and externally, that is, increasing the understanding of Industry 4.0, and by focusing on ‘human-assisted applicability’ or the human touch. The analysis enabled the development of a model illuminating conceptual and practical implications.}

Extant studies have not systematically analyzed the theoretical underpinnings of the form of energy diplomacy that can drive energy transition. This article proposes the concept of ‘renewable energy diplomacy’, which is comprised of four interconnected elements: Collaborative Resource Governance, Digital Trust Building, Energy-Environment Interdependence and Capacity Building. Renewable energy diplomacy provides a theoretical foundation based on environmental peacebuilding to address the critical geopolitical challenges that constrain energy transition.}

Energy Digital Twins are a relatively new area of research, only gaining popularity in industry applications and academia recently. where a comprehensive literature review uncovered only one ‘true’ Energy Digital Twin application across published research to date. To address this research gap, an Energy Digital Twin for smart manufacturing systems was developed and evaluated in this study. In particular, the study focused on bidirectional parameter communication between the physical and the virtual part with the aim of optimizing the energy used in the manufacturing process. To address this research gap, the research objective is to create and evaluate an application of an energy optimizing Digital Twin for a Heating Tunnel. Following the definition of a Digital Twin, the research methodology and experimental setup have three major components: i) the Heating Tunnel as the physical object, ii) the digital counterpart constructed using Python to house the digital control logic and linear energy optimization feedback model, and iii) the connecting fabric, in form of a bidirectional OPC UA communication protocol. The optimization model ingests input parameters of setpoint temperature, power level, and targeted overshoot time, and after running the simulation, returns a calculated value of the required turn off temperature to the real-time heating process of the physical system. Results show that the Energy Digital Twin is effective at maintaining the maximum temperature range of the Heating Tunnel during the heating process, in addition to reducing the energy consumption and cost for all trial runs compared to the original process. Overall, the study successfully created and evaluated a functioning energy optimizing Digital Twin with bidirectional, automated feedback. The results of this research emphasize the potential impact of Energy Digital Twin applications in any manufacturing process and show the promise of future work in this realm of Energy Digital Twins.}

abstract = {Digitization is often presented in policy discourse as a panacea to a multitude of contemporary problems, not least in healthcare. How can policy promises relating to digitization be assessed and potentially countered in particular local contexts? Based on a study in Denmark, we suggest scrutinizing the politics of digitization by comparing policy promises about the future with practitioners’ experience in the present. While Denmark is one of the most digitalized countries in the world, digitization of pathology has only recently been given full policy attention. As pathology departments are faced with an increased demand for pathology analysis and a shortage of pathologists, Danish policymakers have put forward digitization as a way to address these challenges. Who is it that wants to digitize pathology, why, and how does digitization unfold in routine work practices? Using online search and document analysis, we identify actors and analyze the policy promises describing expectations associated with digitization. We then use interviews and observations to juxtapose these expectations with observations of everyday pathology practices as experienced by pathologists. We show that policymakers expect digitization to improve speed, patient safety, and diagnostic accuracy, as well as efficiency. In everyday practice, however, digitization does not deliver on these expectations. Fulfillment of policy expectations instead hinges on the types of artificial intelligence (AI) applications that are still to be developed and implemented. Some pathologists remark that AI might work in the easy cases, but this would leave them with only the difficult cases, which they consider too burdensome. Our particular mode of juxtaposing policy and practice throws new light on the political work done by policy promises and helps to explain why the discipline of pathology does not seem to easily lend itself to the digital embrace.}

However, this article demonstrates that the digital transformation of companies has substantially altered this relationship and its underlying mechanisms. The authors first theoretically develop the different influences of digital transformation on the traditional market share–profitability framework. Subsequently, they estimate a firm–profitability model based on a sample of 6,389 observations from 824 U.S. firms over 25 years that accounts for companies’ degree of digital transformation by text mining their financial statements using a self-developed and validated dictionary. The authors find a significantly negative interaction between the degree of digital transformation of a company and the impact of market share on profitability. However, they also show that this effect is moderated by i) a firm’s digital transformation emphasis (i.e., digital transformation of internal vs. external processes; digital transformation through platformization), ii) a firm’s general strategic emphasis (value appropriation relative to value creation), and iii) a firm’s general market environment (B2C versus B2B). The findings suggest that managers and investors of digital companies should exercise caution when relying on market share as a metric for performance.}

Thus, this study examined the intricate interplay among Logical Thinking Skills, Digital Literacy, and Self-Learning Capability in shaping the effectiveness of accounting internships for Generation Z students in Thailand. Using a quantitative research design with online surveys, this study engaged 559 respondents (90.7 % females and 9.3 % males). Analyzed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), the study found that Logical Thinking Skills and Digital Literacy significantly influence internship performance. When complemented by Self-Learning Capability, it's observed that students with high competency in these areas can better apply their skills in real-world professional settings and demonstrate continuous learning. They actively incorporate online information and media into their learning and self-development, further enhancing their skill set and career proficiency. This study underscores the importance of accounting education in Thai educational institutions offering accounting programs. It emphasizes that these skills should be integrated into the curriculum, especially in the digital age, to equip students to adapt effectively to the evolving demands of the accounting profession.}

Following characterisation of Environmental, Social and Governance practices, Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) was applied to three use cases and the process evaluated and compared to business-as-usual decision-making processes. MCDA was intuitive, widely understood, models were easily developed by working with relevant staff to identify alternative options for ranking, appropriate criteria, measures, and parameters. MCDA was effectively applied to a wide range of decision problems related to materiality ranking, investment, and capability prioritisation. The process drove broader stakeholder engagement, revealed and challenged implicit assumptions and preferences on cost minimisation, improved robustness and transparency of decision-making, and, through integration of non-economic criteria, shifted favoured alternatives in all use cases. We pinpoint challenges and opportunities for broad-scale adoption of MCDA.}

Therefore, managing risk exposure and cybersecurity strategies is essential for digitized companies that aim to survive in competitive markets. However, understanding company-specific risks and quantifying their associated costs is not trivial. Current approaches fail to approximate the individualized financial impact of cyber incidents with a monetary estimation. Additionally, due to limited resources and technical expertise, SMEs, but also large companies, struggle to quantify their cyberattack exposure. Therefore, novel approaches must be built to contribute to a better understanding of the financial loss associated with cyberattacks. This article introduces the Real Cyber Value at Risk (RCVaR), an economical approach for estimating cybersecurity costs using real-world information from public cybersecurity reports. RCVaR identifies the most significant cyber risk factors from various sources and combines their quantitative results to estimate specific cyberattack costs for companies. Furthermore, RCVaR extends current methods to achieve cost and risk estimations based on historical real-world data instead of only probability-based simulations. The evaluation of the approach on unseen data shows the high accuracy and efficiency of the RCVaR in predicting and managing cyber risks. Thus, we argue that the RCVaR is a valuable addition to cybersecurity planning and risk management processes.}

FinTech, considered an accelerator of sustainable economic growth, is part of the technological innovations related to sustainable finance. Through the analysis of an exploratory case study of international importance, represented by the bank BNP Paribas, this article uses the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to investigate the factors that influence technological innovation in the banking sector. The results show that social influence, reinforced by ESG factors, is a variable that encourages technology adoption in the banking sector. Collaborations with FinTech companies support banks in achieving sustainability objectives more efficiently. This study makes an important contribution to the academic literature. It expands knowledge on the determinants of financial technology diffusion by analysing the effect of ESG factors not considered in previous literature. The study also presents practical implications for banks and policy makers.

This paper empirically investigates the impact of enterprise digital transformation on low-carbon urban development, based on matched “firm-city” data covering the period 2006–2020. The SBM-DDF model is employed to assess low-carbon urban development, and the text mining approach is utilized to calculate the digital transformation index of enterprises. The results indicate that enterprise digital transformation significantly facilitates low-carbon urban development and the primary mechanisms involve fostering green technology innovation, increasing the scale of green investment, and driving the transformation of industrial structure. This promotional effect is positively reinforced by government environmental concerns, government environmental subsidies, and fintech development. Additionally, the positive impact of digital transformation on low-carbon development occurs more predominantly in regions with lower levels of industrialization and marketization, and this effect becomes more evident after the digital transformation wave. By establishing a micro-level empirical foundation, this paper aims to contribute to digital transformation strategic decision-making within enterprises, while also offering a tangible and feasible pathway for advancing low-carbon urban transformation initiatives.}

As an outcome, this study has identified relevant challenges that include heterogeneity, integration and interoperability, distributed security, trust, scalability, and resource management. It has also been found that very limited research covers the architectural aspects of distributed edge in the context of the convergence of technologies for Dataspace integration purposes. Therefore, this study has proposed an architectural framework – Distributed Edge Network Operations-oriented Semantic (DENOS) model that extends the traditional Cloud–Edge-Device architecture with three new layers – Semantic, Convergence, and Dataspace integration. In addition, the model leverages the power of semantic modelling (i.e., Processing, Service, and Data) context, which enables the model to have a dynamic implementation context to suit the diverse needs of target use cases. To showcase the validation of the model, a use case related to the digital traceable operation of the wind energy domain has been presented. The objective of the DENOS model is to enable Dataspace integration to build edge-enabled value chain networks. Thus, it contributes to secure and semantic integration using the convergence of resources and technologies, cross-domain collaboration, reusability and data-driven decision-making of resources.}

By integrating DIGE, RIS, and innovation output into a unified analytical framework, this study examined the impact and mechanisms of DIGE on innovation output across 330 Chinese cities from 2011 to 2020. Results show that DIGE development significantly contributes to innovation output. This contribution is mediated by DIGE's strengthening of the RIS, primarily through its facilitation of integration into innovation networks and enhancement of the innovation environment. Regional heterogeneities are evident in the innovation-promoting influence of DIGE, with less developed cities, cities with underdeveloped infrastructure, and smaller cities benefiting more significantly. While the direct impact of DIGE on large central cities is subtle, their pivotal positions enable them to radiate and disseminate innovation spillovers to connected cities through extensive cooperative networks. This study underscored the potential of leveraging DIGE, especially in disadvantaged regions, to cultivate robust and synergistic RIS and act as catalysts for augmented innovation output.}

abstract = {Managing supply chain (SC) relationships to deal with challenges posed by contemporary social and business environments is a difficult task that can be facilitated with the use of digital technologies. The growing complexity of supply chains, characterized by over-dependencies on geographically dispersed partners across different regions, increases risks related to managing these relationships and highlights the importance of collaboration and balancing the power dynamics between SC partners. Previous studies have shown that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) can be considered the weakest link in terms of digitization and balance of power. This article aims to analyse how buyer-seller power relations moderate the relationship between the adoption of digital technologies in supply chain management (SCM) processes and innovation performance in the context of SMEs. Data were collected from manufacturing SMEs operating in Portugal. The results support the assumption that the use of digital technologies in processes related to SCM has a positive effect on SMEs innovation performance. The results also suggest that non-mediated power and reward-mediated positively moderate the relationship between the adoption of digital technologies and innovation performance, while the impact of coercive-mediated power was not confirmed. The article contributes to theory and practice by advancing the literature and guiding managers in the challenging task of carrying out digital transformation initiatives, considering their relationship with the power dynamics in the complex context of SMEs.}

Wearables may enable continuous health care provider-patient partnerships and reduce the volume of episodic clinic-based care (thereby reducing health care costs). However, challenges arise from the unregulated use of these devices, including questionable data reliability, potential misinterpretation of information, unintended psychological impacts, and an influx of clinically nonactionable data that may overburden the health care system. Further, these technologies could exacerbate, rather than mitigate, health disparities. Experience with wearables in atrial fibrillation underscores these challenges. The prevalent use of D2C wearables necessitates a collaborative approach among stakeholders to ensure effective integration into cardiovascular care. Wearables are heralding innovative disease screening, diagnosis, and management paradigms, expanding therapeutic avenues, and anchoring personalized medicine.}

Urban water systems maintain intricate interconnections with other critical infrastructure domains (CIDs). Multi-sector dependencies and joint management of different CIDs have gained interest in recent research to mitigate undesired cascading effects across domains. Yet, combined modeling and joint simulation of multiple CIDs needs to overcome the limitations of tools and software often siloed to individual infrastructure domains. In this paper, we contribute a systematic review of 24 recent peer-reviewed publications on coupled simulation of urban water systems (water supply and drainage networks) and other CIDs, including energy grids, mobility networks, and IT infrastructure systems, extracted from a larger set of 222 publications. First, we identify trends, modeling frameworks, and simulation software enabling the combined simulation of interlinked CIDs. Then, we define an agenda of priorities for future research. Acknowledging the opportunities provided by open-source tools, data, and standardized evaluation schemes, future research fostering coupled simulation across CIDs should prioritize knowledge transfer, address differences in spatial and temporal dependencies, scale up simulations to a network level, and explore multi-sector interconnections beyond bilateral dependencies.}

Nonetheless, IML solutions tend to overlook critical factors such as the timing, frequency and workload that drive this interaction and are vital to adapting these systems to users’ goals and engagement. To address this gap, this work explores users’ expectations towards IML solutions in the context of an interactive hydration monitoring system for the workplace, which represents a challenging environment to implement intelligent solutions that can collaborate with individuals. The proposed system involves users in the learning process by providing feedback on the success of detecting their drinking gestures and enabling them to contribute with additional examples of their data. A qualitative study was conducted to evaluate this use case, where participants completed specific tasks with varying levels of involvement. This study provides promising insights into the potential of placing the Human-in-the-Loop (HitL) to adapt and reconceptualize the users’ role in interactive solutions, highlighting the importance of considering human factors in designing more effective and flexible collaborative systems between humans and machines.}

This perspective highlights the importance of addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) in patient health outcomes and health inequity, a global problem exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide a broad discussion on current developments in digital health and artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models (LLMs), as transformative tools in addressing SDOH factors, offering new capabilities for disease surveillance and patient care. Simultaneously, we bring attention to challenges, such as data standardization, infrastructure limitations, digital literacy, and algorithmic bias, that could hinder equitable access to AI benefits. For LLMs, we highlight potential unique challenges and risks including environmental impact, unfair labor practices, inadvertent disinformation or “hallucinations,” proliferation of bias, and infringement of copyrights. We propose the need for a multitiered approach to digital inclusion as an SDOH and the development of ethical and responsible AI practice frameworks globally and provide suggestions on bridging the gap from development to implementation of equitable AI technologies.}

With the rapid adoption of smart farming technologies and infrastructure, the agricultural sector has become an attractive target for cyberattacks. This paper presents a systematic literature review that assesses the applicability of existing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) techniques within smart farming infrastructures (SFIs). We develop a comprehensive taxonomy of CTI techniques and sources, specifically tailored to the SFI context, addressing the unique cyber threat challenges in this domain. A crucial finding of our review is the identified need for a virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) in smart agriculture. While the concept of a vCISO is not yet established in the agricultural sector, our study highlights its potential significance. The implementation of a vCISO could play a pivotal role in enhancing cybersecurity measures by offering strategic guidance, developing robust security protocols, and facilitating real-time threat analysis and response strategies. This approach is critical for safeguarding the food supply chain against the evolving landscape of cyber threats. Our research underscores the importance of integrating a vCISO framework into smart farming practices as a vital step towards strengthening cybersecurity. This is essential for protecting the agriculture sector in the era of digital transformation, ensuring the resilience and sustainability of the food supply chain against emerging cyber risks.}

Drawing inspiration from seminal work in human-plant geographies, it explores the governmental functions and political implications of green resilience, arguing that these spaces serve as key forms of state rule and biopolitical power. The study employs the notion of green resilience as a “composition,” emphasizing the assembling of diverse human and nonhuman actors in resilience projects. The developed compositional ontology highlights the importance of aesthetic and visual practices in green resilience projects and reveals how these are continuously decomposed and recomposed by the involved actors. The paper develops its arguments through a “paradigmatic case study” of various green resilience projects in New York City – including survivor trees, memorial groves, and community gardens. The study illuminates the multiplicity of green resilience initiatives and the underlying governmental logic by comparing these projects. Through its analysis, the paper contributes to the literature on resilience as an emerging governance paradigm. It reveals how green resilience projects embody a multiplicity of practices, uncovers the first comprehensive comparative analysis of various forms of green resilience, and offers a critique of resilience from within. The study concludes by identifying three tensions or contradictions of (green) resilience as a form of biopolitical government: visibility and invisibility, knowledge and ignorance, and control and emergence.}

This research also contributes to digital transformation literature and to the institutional theory. We develop a conceptual framework for analyzing enterprise digital transformation, and generate some theoretical prescriptions. The research findings conclude that, based on innovation in digital technology by generations, enterprise digital transformation on strategic positioning, value proposition (services and products), and value creation (assets and organizational structure) presents a process by stages; both institutional pressures and technological attraction impact how SOEs carry out digital transformation; different SOEs with different characteristics in value creation present different transformation process. Future research could use the framework as an analytical tool and draw upon the theoretical prescriptions to examine digital transformation in different kinds of organizations. At last, this research also offers practical insights for SOEs to carry out digital transformations and for governments to offer supportive institutional environment for this process.}

Nevertheless, creating and implementing smart solutions is complex and instigates paradoxical tensions among ecosystem actors, often leading to hurdles and possibly failures. Though recent studies have focused on identifying these tensions, a comprehensive understanding of their interrelationships is necessary. This study aims to identify the paradoxical tensions that exist among companies in digital servitization ecosystems as well as unravel their interrelationships. To address these objectives, we apply a multi-method approach. First, a systematic review of the literature reveals 16 paradoxical tensions arising from inter-firm collaboration. Next, based on interviews with academic and industry experts, we assess the relationships among these tensions. In particular, we focus on the perspective of technology providers due to their importance in delivering smart solutions. Finally, we apply Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and fuzzy Matrices d’Impacts Croises Multiplication Appliqué a un Classement (MICMAC) to the experts' responses to define the interrelationships between the identified tensions and cluster them based on their driving and dependence power. We adopt a paradox theory lens to classify the identified tensions into four categories—i.e., learning, belonging, organizing, and performing—and provide a conceptual framework showing their cause-and-effect relationships. We reveal that paradoxical tensions in digital servitization ecosystems do not exist in isolation; rather, they are interconnected. Furthermore, we provide practical recommendations for managers to cope with such tensions as well as suggestions for future research.}

Hence, the research analyses how 371 B2B firms from developed and emerging European countries achieve competitive advantage through green marketing strategies. Additionally, those firms are also assessed in reference to their level of engagement with environmental, social, and governance strategies. Our findings highlight that the more the engagement in green marketing by B2B firms, the greater the green competitive advantage that B2B firms in developed European markets can achieve. Hence, the study explores the relationship of B2B marketing, environmental sustainability, and corporate profitability, providing insights into how European firms can balance their financial objectives with their social and environmental responsibilities.

abstract = {Digital transformation (DT) stands as a pivotal technological revolution that has emerged as a critical development strategy across industries for its effectiveness in fostering competitive advantages. However, the adoption of DT within the construction industry remains notably lagging, and small and medium-sized construction enterprises (SMCEs), constrained by limited resources, antiquated technologies, and constrained risk tolerance compared to large enterprises, encounter heightened impediments in undertaking DT. Current research on DT in the construction industry focuses predominantly on large enterprises or the industry holistically. These studies allocate relatively diminished focus to the imprecision of expert opinions and the impact of expert behavioral factors on decision outcomes. We construct a barriers examination framework aimed at ranking the barriers for DT in SMCEs. The proposed framework comprises two pivotal components: (1) the technical, organizational, and environmental barriers for DT in SMCEs; (2) an enhanced collective opinion generation paradigm driven by the social-welfare and confidence optimizing approach. Following the proposed framework, experts are tasked with assessing 14 barriers based on 5 levels of importance. The probability theory approach is applied to model expert opinions as probability distribution functions (PDFs) to reduce the inherent imprecision of expert opinions. The proposed social-welfare and confidence optimizing approach is utilized for aggregating individual PDFs to generate collective PDFs representing the importance level of each barrier. An empirical survey on SMCEs in Wuhan proves the feasibility and validity of the proposed barriers examination framework and indicates that the largest barrier to implement DT for SMCEs in Wuhan is the lack of standards and regulations, followed by the lack of clear strategic planning. The study not only summarizes the barriers for DT in SMCEs, but also adopts the social-welfare and confidence optimizing approach to improve the objectivity and reliability of the collective opinion, therefore, the conclusion can provide a reference for SMCEs to implement DT.}

In this study, a systematic review of the relevant literature was conducted to identify the factors that contribute to enhancing IoT applications in the construction industry. The primary objective was to list and evaluate the most important uses, advantages and difficulties of using the IoT in the building sector. This systematic review revealed that the IoT has significant potential to transform the construction industry by improving productivity, safety, sustainability and quality across the entire construction lifecycle. However, barriers such as data privacy and cybersecurity and a lack of standardised protocols need to be addressed. The review concludes that the IoT is likely to revolutionise the construction sector in the coming years if these challenges can be overcome. These findings imply that construction firms need to experiment with IoT and analytic tools across phased use cases, whilst policy and industry groups must collaborate on technology standards and protocols. Although obstacles exist, strategic IoT implementation promises major operational breakthroughs in the construction sector in the near future.}

abstract = {The interest in artificial intelligence (AI) in education has erupted during the last few years, primarily due to technological advances in AI. It is therefore argued that students should learn about AI, although it is debated exactly how it should be applied in education. AI literacy has been suggested as a way of defining competencies for students to acquire to meet a future everyday- and working life with AI. This study argues that researchers and educators need a framework for integrating AI literacy into technological literacy, where the latter is viewed as a multiliteracy. This study thus aims to critically analyse and discuss different components of AI literacy found in the literature in relation to technological literacy. The data consists of five AI literacy frameworks related to three traditions of technological knowledge: technical skills, technological scientific knowledge, and socio-ethical technical understanding. The results show that AI literacy for technology education emphasises technological scientific knowledge (e.g., knowledge about what AI is, how to recognise AI, and systems thinking) and socio-ethical technical understanding (e.g., AI ethics and the role of humans in AI). Technical skills such as programming competencies also appear but are less emphasised. Implications for technology education are also discussed, and a framework for AI literacy for technology education is suggested.}

abstract = {The railway industry has witnessed increasing adoption of digital technologies, known as Railway 4.0, that is revolutionizing operations, infrastructure, and transportation systems. However, developing countries face challenges in keeping pace with these technological advancements. With limited research on Railway 4.0 adoption in developing countries, this study was motivated to investigate the awareness, readiness, and challenges faced by railway professionals towards implementing Railway 4.0 technologies. The aim was to assess the level of awareness and preparedness and identify the key challenges influencing Railway 4.0 adoption in Nigeria's railway construction industry. A questionnaire survey (was distributed to professionals in the railway construction sector to gather their perspectives on awareness of, preparation for, and challenges associated with the use of Railway 4.0 technologies. The results revealed that awareness of Railway 4.0 technologies was moderate, while readiness was low among the professionals. Using exploratory factor analysis, 10 underlying challenge constructs were identified including lack of technical know-how, resistance to change, infrastructure limitations, and uncertainty about benefits, amongst others. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) confirmed these constructs, with reliability and availability, lack of technical know-how, lack of training and resources, and uncertainties in benefit and gains having significant influence on awareness and readiness. The study concludes that focused efforts in training, infrastructure improvement, supportive policies, and communicating the advantages of Railway 4.0 are critical to drive adoption in Nigeria and other developing economies. The findings provide insights into tailoring Railway 4.0 implementation strategies for developing contexts.}

abstract = {The transformation of dynamic supply chains within the realm of offsite manufacturing presents a unique and compelling opportunity to effectively respond to shifts in market demand. However, this paradigm shift also entails novel challenges and prospects for streamlining processes, augmenting efficiency, and ultimately driving success across production workflows and logistical operations. Dynamic supply chains necessitate unimpeded access to high-quality, dependable data to facilitate real-time, data-driven decision-making. Furthermore, owing to their inherently intricate nature, these supply chains are subject to a heightened vulnerability to disruptions and delays, surpassing those encountered in traditional supply chains. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes a framework that synthesises the convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), Building Information Modelling (BIM), and blockchain technology (BCT) into a cohesive and integrated system, thereby optimising the efficiency and transparency of supply chain management operations. The proposed framework takes cognisance of the challenges inherent in ensuring information traceability, mitigating fragmented information, enhancing interoperability, and fortifying reliability throughout the design, production, and implementation phases of assets within dynamic supply chains operating in the offsite manufacturing domain. To illustrate the efficacy of our proposition, we present a framework that exemplifies the seamless integration of a permissioned, open-source distributed ledger, which forms the bedrock of our support infrastructure for IoT and BIM integration. Through rigorous analysis, we showcase the effectiveness of the developed framework in the form of a designed Supply Chain Management Model (SCMM-PDO), which harmonises the physical, digital, and operational layers within a robust system architecture (BCT.IoT-BIM). The integration of these technologies provides a decentralised solution, reinforcing supply chains with improved security, reliability, and quality control mechanisms, thus enhancing the efficiency of the supply chain network. It is anticipated that this transformative integration will yield substantial improvements in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as operational efficiency, cost reduction, and the cultivation of trust and accountability across supply chain activities. The research proposes an IoT and BIM conceptual framework that simulates the dynamic supply chain operations, facilitating real-time analysis and prediction of supply chain participants' behaviours from resources, processes, and assets. Furthermore, the integration of IoT-BIM (digital twinning) with a blockchain-based system, such as Hyperledger Fabric, engenders a secure and transparent framework for the diligent tracking of assets and information throughout the supply chain. The findings of this study offer an all-encompassing conceptual framework for the secure and transparent tracking of asset information by integrating Blockchain-based technologies with IoT and BIM. This research endeavour thus expands the existing body of knowledge, establishing a foundation for future investigations within this proliferating field.}

The study employed the grounded-theory methodology to situate our research within the context of users' real experiences and used the Gioia technique to adopt a qualitative research strategy to explore the themes that arose from the participant replies. The Uses & Gratification Theory (UGT) was found to be in line with the themes that were derived from the participants' opinions. The first part of our study aimed to explore people's perception of “what is digital hoarding?”. Our study's focal research question was targeted at finding out what gratifications people get from hoarding digital photos and how those gratifications motivate their digital hoarding behavior. Different stakeholders in the digital world can obtain a deeper understanding of the numerous uses and gratifications that drive people's digital hoarding behavior, which can help develop strategies for encouraging more effective and meaningful digital photo management by illuminating the psychological and practical aspects of digital hoarding. This will ultimately improve people's digital experiences and lessen the burden of excessive data accumulation in the digital age.}

abstract = {This study introduces the Complex T-Spherical Fuzzy Soft Set (CTSFSS), a novel and practical model for representing two-dimensional ambiguous information. This is achieved by integrating the Complex T-Spherical Fuzzy Set (CTSFS) with the Soft Set (SS). The development of the CTSFSS theory is motivated by the absence of neutral membership in complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy soft sets and the limitations of Traditional Spherical Fuzzy Soft Sets (TSFSS) in capturing two-dimensional data. Data storage and processing in the modern technological landscape necessitate sophisticated algorithmic computations and robust representation of information. To this end, computational systems predominantly rely on a binary system structured on two fundamental states: 0 (off) and 1 (on). Moreover, the significance of energy resources and computer-aided tools is underscored in this domain, especially considering the potential impact of quantum computing and advances in energy resources on the evolution of digital technology. In addressing these complexities, we propose Complex T-Spherical Fuzzy Soft Relations (CTSFSRs), formulated through the Cartesian product of two CTSFSSs. These relations are adept at handling complex and uncertain data in real-world scenarios. We define and categorize various types of CTSFSRs, followed by an in-depth analysis of their outcomes. Additionally, this paper introduces innovative visualization techniques based on CTSFSRs, tailored for decision-making processes involving energy resources and quantum computing applications. The efficacy and applicability of these proposed methodologies are substantiated through comparative analysis with existing models.}

This study also analyses the direct effects of innovation constructs and the indirect effects of digital resources on sustainable performance. Survey data were collected from 164 maritime professionals from various functions and sectors in the maritime industry. The structural equation modelling analysis revealed that all identified digital resources have a significant, positive correlation with innovation constructs, as well as a positive indirect effect on sustainable performance. Furthermore, as compared to exploitative innovation, exploratory innovation generates a greater positive effect on sustainable performance. This study enriches theoretical research by enhancing the understanding of resource-based view and organisational ambidexterity. It also explores the tensions between exploratory and exploitative innovation, as well as the definition of sustainable performance. It offers managerial implications by recommending how the management can utilise technical and social digital resources and innovation to improve sustainable performance via better long-term planning and corporate decisions. In addition, this study also enables firms to prioritise their allocation of resources where finances or manpower are scarce.}

Relying on in-depth interviews with 27 executives responsible for subscriptions, we outline four key characteristics and distinctive features of subscriptions and provide a refined definition. Next, we develop a taxonomy that classifies subscription offers into four distinct categories based on two dimensions: service focus and resource integration. This classification framework is essential as it adds depth and precision to the analysis of B2B subscriptions. Without it, the assessment would be overly simplified and lacking in detail. We also demonstrate how subscriptions can help firms seize growth opportunities and enhance the customer experience.

This makes it possible for the system to recognize, react to, and resolve various problems. Power users of digital technology can take an active role and have the ability to cure themselves. Cybercrimes affecting the security of the smart grid include the compromise of vital client data by attackers, the spread of viruses, cybersecurity mistakes, and vulnerabilities in distributed systems. In order to identify the multi-stage cyberattacks that pose a threat to the smart grid, a novel Multi-Stage Cyber Intelligence (MSCI) technique has been developed in this work. A signal is generated by an intrusion detection system (IDS) sensor and passed through a Chebyshev filter for preprocessing in order to minimize its noise level. The risk will be identified by the security identification block, which also includes risk assessment, risk estimation, and risk identification. The Risk Identification Block finds the risk by gaining access to the Cyber Information Database. If the risk is not found, it is transmitted to the BI-LSTM Network, which verifies if it is an attack. A MATLAB simulator is used to implement the proposed approach. Evaluation criteria like Precision, F1 Score, Specificity, Accuracy, and Detective Rate have been used to assess the effectiveness of the Multi-Stage Cyber Intelligence (MSCI) technique approach that has been provided. The experimental results show that the suggested MSCI strategy has a 99% success rate, which is comparatively high when compared to the current approaches of 9.09%, 22.22%, and 47.47% for the CDS, AD-IOT, and SVM techniques, respectively.}

There is little empirical research that illuminates the circumstances under which intuitive decision making versus deliberative decision making influences trust. Lack of trust in technology and information systems has been suggested as a bottleneck in advancement. Through a survey we aimed to better understand the phenomenon of intuitive decision making of farmers and bankers. The main research purpose is to compare and contrast decision making styles of two environmentally different professions from a heterogeneous sample from different countries.

This article conducts a state-of-the-art review of the key pillars of power system resilience, examining the concepts and techniques to improve resilience against low-probability, high-impact events. The highlighted pillars include smartening, hardening, distributing, building, and the corresponding enhancement techniques. The article begins by enlightening the origin of resilience and its relevance in the power system context, followed by an exploration of the four key pillars. Additionally, it investigates the quantification of resilience in different levels of power systems facing diverse sources of extreme events. Emerging technologies that played a crucial role in enhancing resilience are discussed. Furthermore, the paper explores the concept of Greenfield and Brownfield power system design approaches to improve resilience against extreme events. Moreover, a transformative idea extending the conventional resilience philosophy, called antifragility, is clearly stated. The discussion extends to the need for resilience study from global perspectives, state-of-the-art technologies, and challenges and opportunities.

This research proposes a new semi-supervised network data stream anomaly detection method, Split Active Learning Anomaly Detector (SALAD), which combines our novel Adaptive Anomaly Threshold and Stochastic Anomaly Threshold with Fading Factor methods. A novel Reconstruction Error based Distance from Threshold strategy is proposed and evaluated as part of an active stream framework to demonstrate reduction in labeling costs. The proposed methods are evaluated with the KDD Cup 1999, and UNSW-NB15 data sets, using the scikit-multiflow framework. Results demonstrated that the proposed SALAD method offered equivalent performance to full labeled and alternative Naïve Bayes (NB) and Hoeffding Adaptive Tree (HAT) methods, with a labeling budget of just 20%, significantly reducing the required human expertise to annotate the network data. Processing times of the SALAD method were demonstrated to be significantly lower than NB and HAT methods, allowing for greatly improved responsiveness to attacks occurring in real time.}

abstract = {Code obfuscation is a promising technique for securing software and protecting it from adversaries. The objective is to harden the exploitation of security vulnerabilities for the attacker as well as launching of successful attacks. Obfuscation can be classified into layout, data, and control flow obfuscation. Control flow obfuscation impedes the understanding of the application logic by making it complicated to determine the actual control flows. Although numerous control flow methods exist in the literature, the role of existing compiler optimizations has just been discovered. This paper is the first one that explores the existing optimization space of LLVM compiler for obfuscating code. Our techniques optimally explore the native compiler's optimizations to improve the original code performance and reduce memory space with no disruptive efforts, tools, or extra costs. In the CBench benchmark suite, our work is able to improve 246%, 143%, and 468% in cyclomatic complexity, program length, and implementation effort, respectively, compared to unobfuscated code. Therefore, instead of inventing new obfuscation tools, the existing compiler optimizations can easily be used to obfuscate control flows, saving the overall cost and efforts.}

Interestingly, however, the investment community has been scarcely studied, despite the critical role of financing in technology innovation. This paper attempts to characterize investors' perceptions around the concept of digital innovation governance. We present insights derived from qualitative research using constructivist grounded theory, based on a series of interviews to 23 venture capital investment managers. Analysis of the data collected suggests several categories of important factors regarding how venture capital managers engage in Digital Innovation Governance (DIG): legitimacy of involvement, opportunity of conducting and capability to lead DIG initiatives in the invested startups. We offer a structured inventory of venture capital manager insights and perceptions on innovation governance. According to our research, venture capital managers, and investors in general, find themselves capable of and see opportunities and relevance in effectively fostering a digital innovation governance that takes into account the potential risks of Artificial Intelligence and identifies business and societal opportunities.}

This integration enables real-time monitoring, control, and optimization of electricity demand and supply. However, the increasing reliance on ICT infrastructures has made the SG-CPS more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Hence, securing the SG-CPS from these threats is crucial for its reliable operation. In recent literature, machine learning (ML) techniques and, more recently, deep learning (DL) techniques have been used by several studies to implement cybersecurity countermeasures against cyberattacks in SG-CPS. Nevertheless, the achieving high performance of these state-of-the-art techniques is constrained by certain challenges, including hyperparameter optimization, feature extraction and selection, lack of models’ transparency, data privacy, and lack of real-time attack data. This paper reviews the advancement in using ML and DL techniques for cybersecurity countermeasures in SG-CPS. It analyzes the constraints that need to be addressed to improve performance and achieve real-time implementation. The various types of cyberattacks, cybersecurity requirements, and security standards and protocols are also discussed to establish a comprehensive understanding of the cybersecurity context in SG-CPS. This paper will serve as a comprehensive guide for new and experienced researchers.}

The South African manufacturing sector, consisting of approximately 11,400 VAT-registered organizations, is explored in a novel approach. No prior study has analyzed the cointegrating and long-run effects of I4.0 on this sector. The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is employed, accommodating both stationary and nonstationary variables without recalculating the order of integration. To address endogeneity, small sample bias, serial correlation, and heterogeneity, the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) models are estimated. Long-run relationships among variables, including manufacturing value added (MVA), I4.0, carbon dioxide emissions, Foreign Direct Investments (FDI), and inflation, are considered. Vector Autoregressive (VECM) modeling is used to establish causality relationships, while the Cumulative Dynamic Multiplier (CDM) visually illustrates impact relationships. Data from the World Bank's WDI (2023), covering the period 2000Q1–2020Q4, are employed. Key findings include a significant negative relationship between I4.0 and South Africa's MVA. Policy implications suggest substantial investments in advanced education, Information and Communications Technology (ICT), and medium to high technology exploration. The study reveals positive associations between carbon dioxide and MVA, significant short and long-run impacts of FDI on MVA, and a long-run relationship between inflation and MVA. These insights provide valuable considerations for strategic investments and policy decisions in the context of technological advancements.}

We argue that the successful adoption of generative AI in the creative industries lies in finding the delicate balance between maintaining human ingenuity and reaping the benefits of technological innovation. Unlike other industrial sectors, where AI primarily automates repetitive tasks, creative professionals can use generative AI as a collaborative tool to spark new avenues for creativity, streamline workflows, and accelerate creative processes.

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Power System (CPPS) refers to a system in which the elements of the internet and the physical power system communicate and work together. With the use of modern communication and information technology, grid monitoring and control have improved. However, the components of a cyber system are extremely vulnerable to cyberattacks via cyber connections due to inadequate cyber security measures. Therefore, an adaptive defence strategy is required for the analysis and mitigation of the coordinated attack. The conventional approach of using an offline controller requires tuning for changes in the operating conditions of the system, which is inappropriate for the modern CPPS. To counter the coordinated attack, a framework that integrates STATCOM based Adaptive Model Predictive Controller with RPME and time delay compensator is proposed. This paper addresses attack impact, detection, and mitigation methods in CPPS. In both time domain and frequency domain simulations the case studies are conducted for three distinct situations namely physical attack, cyberattack, and coordinated attack. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) are four data-driven methods used for the detection of anomalies in PMU measurement data. Simulation studies show that CNN performs better in anomaly detection than other classifiers based on assessed performance metrics. For coordinated attack mitigation the proposed STATCOM based Adaptive Model Predictive Controller with RPME quickly recovers the system than the STATCOM based conventional lead-lag controller. The efficacy of the proposed strategy is validated on the WSCC 3 machine 9 bus system.}

abstract = {Innovativeness and digitalization of enterprises of various countries is fundamental to their development and building a competitive knowledge-based economy. These issues are well understood in the European Union (EU), which promotes sustainable development of its economy, for which innovativeness and digitalization are of vital importance. The paper addresses this issue by presenting the results of a study of the level of innovativeness and digitalization of enterprises in the countries of the EU. The objectives of the research were to assess the level of innovativeness and digitalization of enterprises in the EU-27 states and to determine a relationship between digitalization and the level of innovativeness of these enterprises, as well as the impact of selected economic, energy, social and environmental parameters on these processes. The importance and interaction of these areas, as well as their impact on the economy, causes the methodology developed and the research conducted to consider both these dimensions of business activity simultaneously. To achieve these goals, an original research methodology was developed. Its basis was a set of 18 selected indicators characterizing the state of digitalization and innovativeness of enterprises in the EU-27 member states. Three methods of Multiple-criteria decision-making (EDAS, MOORA, VIKOR) and the Hurwicz criterion were used for the primary research. On the other hand, the CRITIC, Entropy and equal weights methods and the Laplace criterion were used to determine the weights of indicators. The multi-criteria approach to the issue under study made it possible to achieve the set objectives and formulate conclusions and answers to the research questions posed. The results unequivocally indicate a link between the innovativeness of enterprises and the process of their digitalization and R&D expenditures in the EU countries. The level of innovativeness and digitalization is definitely higher in the group of the so-called "old EU-14' states than in the "new EU-13" states. The research and its results provide ample opportunities for conclusions as to the state of both studied processes (digitalization and innovativeness) in the enterprises of the EU-27 states. The wide scope of the research carried out makes it possible to use the findings to build strategies and future economic policies of the entire EU and individual countries. The universality of the developed methodology also gives a wide range of possibilities for its application for further research.}

These exchanges may not pose privacy problems until the movement takes extra-territorial turns thereby facing multiple levels of cross-border regulations. In the 80 s, the frequency of transfer of personal data beyond geographical boundaries in Europe precipitated the regulation of transborder data flows (TDF) beginning with the enactment of the Organization for OECD Guidelines. In Africa, the concept of TDF is more complex than usually viewed by the stakeholders and this is partly because neither the African Union nor other regional bodies have introduced legislation on TDF. Like many concepts in data protection, TDF is bereft of a generally accepted meaning. Regardless of the uncertainty, this paper approaches TDF as the transmission of personal data from one country to another country or international entity for the purpose of processing. The paper discusses some definitions of TDF as understood under African regional and national data protection legislation. In a comparative and normative approach, the paper analyses the barriers to TDF in Africa vis a vis the European experience and then concludes with recommendations for workable TDF within and outside the continent from an African perspective beginning with the harmonization of existing regional framework.}

We prioritize Industry 4.0 technologies in the context of agile manufacturing using a comprehensive analysis that employs the TOPSIS and Fuzzy DEMATEL methodologies. Results indicate that cybersecurity, Cloud, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are the most commonly used technologies in agile manufacturing. The fuzzy DEMATEL-based framework identifies cybersecurity, Big data, Cloud, simulation, augmented reality, and IoT as ‘cause’ technologies, while additive manufacturing, robotics, mobile devices, and systems integration are identified as ‘effect’ technologies. The paper proposes practical strategies for managers in India to facilitate the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies, thereby enhancing firms' agility in the digital age. By highlighting the specific technologies critical to agile manufacturing, our study not only addresses a notable gap in the literature but also provides a roadmap for their practical implementation, empowering businesses to thrive in an increasingly digitalized landscape.}

The ability of large organizations to effectively move to remote operations is attributed to their prior experience and comfort with such practices, as well as their capacity to invest in robust software and technology solutions that provide high levels of security. Nevertheless, the implementation of remote work arrangements posed considerable challenges to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), due to their limited past exposure and financial constraints. These variables increased their susceptibility to any decrease in production, even if it was only for a single day. Here by SMEs, we refer to the medium sized organizations. Medium-sized organizations are often the focus of cybercriminals due to their relatively insufficient security systems and processes when compared to larger organizations, making them vulnerable to assaults. As a result of the widespread adoption of remote work arrangements, medium-sized enterprises have exhibited a lower level of preparedness in managing their operations compared to larger organizations. Consequently, this research aims to solve this disparity specifically within the context of medium sized organizations. Exploratory methodology was employed in this study, wherein primary data was collected through in-depth interviews with a sample size of 20 subject matter experts from medium sized organizations. Through the application of content analysis on the transcripts of the interviews, our study has identified eleven distinct criteria that have a significant role in determining the level of organizational preparedness for information security risks in the context of remote work arrangements. In this study, we identified and examined six factors that have been previously discussed in the literature: resource readiness, cultural readiness, strategic readiness, information technology readiness, cognitive readiness, and partnership readiness. Additionally, we discovered five new factors through our research: security valence, cybersecurity risk management through “cyber insurance”, balanced confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA), absence of work-from-home (WFH) policy, and organizational and technical best practices. We discuss the practical and research ramifications of this investigation.}

However, both in the short and long run, investment in sustainable mining technologies, government support for FinTech in mining, and environmental compliance exhibit a negative relationship with resource management. Bidirectional causality is observed between regulatory support for mining FinTech, technological finance solutions, and environmentally conscious mineral practices, while unidirectional causality exists from FinTech adoption to sustainable mining practices. Impulse response functions offer insights into the future impact of variables on eco-conscious mining policies, indicating positive influences from FinTech adoption, government support for FinTech in mining, and technological adaptability over the next decade. Conversely, eco-friendly mining investments, environmental conformity, and social license to operate will impact sustainable mineral utilization. Variance decomposition analysis highlights the most significant shocks on eco-friendly resource management over the next ten years, emphasizing the role of sustainable mining technologies, FinTech adoption, and public support for mining endeavours. In the transition to Industry 4.0, this research provides crucial insights for responsibly utilizing Australia's natural resources by leveraging financial technology and technological readiness.}

However, the complexities of the healthcare landscape introduce unique challenges that impede the widespread adoption of open innovation initiatives and warrant an enquiry into barriers associated with one of the open innovation initiatives, i.e. digital clinic. Hence, this study investigates medical professionals' resistance towards digital clinics in emerging markets. Using innovation resistance theory (IRT) as underpinning theory, the study investigates the effects of performance barriers, value barriers, risk barriers, legal barriers, tradition barriers, and image barriers. This study also examined how the effects of barriers on inertia vary at different levels of medical professionals' personal innovativeness. The structural equation modelling and Process Macro are used to analyze the collected data. The findings indicate that value barriers, risk barriers, legal barriers, and tradition barriers play crucial roles in framing resistance intention towards digital clinics. The study uniquely enriches the emerging literature related to digital clinics by investigating the role of different barriers and inertia in digital clinic adoption. The study helps hospitals understand different barriers towards digital clinic adoption intention.}

This study aims to fill the gaps in characterizing potential use cases for buildings datasets and mapping them to dataset needs using a well-defined data infrastructure. We have developed a systematic mapping strategy between buildings dataset needs and use cases to help streamline the processes of efficiently targeting datasets, designing building sensing systems, and determining buildings research use cases. We selected 14 prospective use cases and 11 refined buildings data categories for developing the preliminary dataset-needs-to-use-cases mapping matrix (‘DN-UC mapping matrix’) with generic ‘Tags’—a detailed sub-level of data categories extracted by justifying the needs of an aspect of the datasets to use cases. We present two example applications of the developed mapping matrix to demonstrate use of the mapping matrix and its effectiveness.}

Our analysis yields four main results. First, Chinese financial sector (with greater downstream network closeness than upstream closeness) drives growth in its downstream sectors and has significant supply-side effects in economy. Second, the financial sector serves as an important network intermediary, facilitating transactions and interactions among various economic sectors. Third, the more externalized (pre-Global Financial Crisis) financial sector, which received significant feedback from other sectors’ final demand, became more internalized after the crisis. Finally, the financial sector is becoming less tightly linked to other sectors, with heterogeneous resource consumption and production distribution, and vulnerability to systemic risks. Policy integration of intersectoral linkages and financial leverage can promote economic growth and manage systemic risks.}

abstract = {The advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) has spurred the development of innovative products, significantly impacting industries reliant on technology-oriented machinery and equipment, notably the construction sector. In response, the Ministry of Works, through CIDB Malaysia, has implemented the Construction Strategy Plan 4.0 (2021 – –2025), grounded in 4IR principles, to facilitate the construction industry's gradual adaptation to technological advancements. Despite its introduction in 2016 to enhance project delivery efficiency and effectiveness, the extent of adoption of advanced 4IR-related technologies and the industry players' awareness of the importance of the Construction 4.0 strategic plan remains largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper examines the awareness and adoption level of CR 4.0 technologies in the Malaysian construction industry through a structured questionnaire survey with all G1-G7 contractors that registered with CIDB Malaysia. Based on 912 valid questionnaire responses received from these contractor grades, it has been identified that the awareness and adoption of most of the contractors in Malaysia on construction 4.0 technologies are predominantly at a semi-automation level. Most of the contractors in Malaysia especially lower grade contractors (<G6 contractor) continue to rely on traditional machinery and methods with a cautious approach towards adopting more advanced technologies, which may require them to incur huge capital investment. The findings highlight a critical need for the government to strategically plan actions to facilitate a transformative agenda in Malaysia construction industry.}

Within the second perspective, we broadened our view and developed the theoretical framework comprising the necessary steps to prepare courses and study programs that respect labor market requirements. This framework is based on action research and design thinking. Our results show that the Curriculum Development and Redesign Framework (CDRF) proved to be useful tool. Students’ perception of task shuffling was overall positive. Only 5.3 % of students answered, “Handing over projects bothered me.” Changes in the size and composition of groups also brought positive results. 43.2 % of students answered, “I am happy, I met new people,” 54 % answered, “It went pretty well,” and just 2.8 % answered, “I did not like it."}

However, the rapid proliferation and dynamism of today’s cyber threats in digital environments may disrupt CI functionalities, which would have a debilitating impact on public safety, economic stability, and national security. This has led to much interest in effective cybersecurity solutions regarding automation and intelligent decision-making, where AI-based modeling is potentially significant. In this paper, we take into account “Rule-based AI” rather than other black-box solutions since model transparency, i.e., human interpretation, explainability, and trustworthiness in decision-making, is an essential factor, particularly in cybersecurity application areas. This article provides an in-depth study on multi-aspect rule based AI modeling considering human interpretable decisions as well as security automation and intelligence for CI. We also provide a taxonomy of rule generation methods by taking into account not only knowledge-driven approaches based on human expertise but also data-driven approaches, i.e., extracting insights or useful knowledge from data, and their hybridization. This understanding can help security analysts and professionals comprehend how systems work, identify potential threats and anomalies, and make better decisions in various real-world application areas. We also cover how these techniques can address diverse cybersecurity concerns such as threat detection, mitigation, prediction, diagnosis for root cause findings, and so on in different CI sectors, such as energy, defence, transport, health, water, agriculture, etc. We conclude this paper with a list of identified issues and opportunities for future research, as well as their potential solution directions for how researchers and professionals might tackle future generation cybersecurity modeling in this emerging area of study.}

Despite well-intentioned efforts by policymakers, the transformation of traditional agricultural systems into smart farms remains a formidable challenge. Drawing on technology acceptance literature and Prospect Theory (PT), this article explores, compares, and prioritizes the factors that influence IoT smart farming adoption, considering both the expected gains and losses. Survey data collected from 265 farmers in Thailand was analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM) to test our hypotheses. The results demonstrate that IoT smart farming is significantly influenced by both the perceived expected gains from its adoption and the perceived expected losses from climate change in the case of not adopting IoT smart farming. However, in contrast to PT, the impact of losses is not greater than that of gains. This article offers valuable insights that are essential for shaping sustainable farming practices and informing policy frameworks in the face of mounting challenges posed by climate change.}

abstract = {Background
The design of software systems plays a crucial role in mitigating cybersecurity incidents. Security by Design (SbD) aims to ensure foundational security throughout the design process. However, it lacks a precise interdisciplinary definition. Comparing it with Privacy by Design (PbD), which has seen more conceptual development, highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of SbD.
Objectives
This study systematically searches and reviews relevant definitions of SbD in comparison with PbD.
Method
Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of SbD and PbD definitions, searching ACM Digital Library, EBSCO Library, IEEE Xplore, ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science. A total of 46 studies were included, identifying 86 definitions. Thirteen themes were identified, including ontology, object of protection, outcome to avoid, means of implementation, added value, and focus of the definition.
Results
Definitions varied in their descriptions of SbD and PbD, the objects of protection, outcomes to avoid, means of implementation, and lifecycle focus. PbD definitions adopted a rights-based approach, anchored in Ann Cavoukian's principles and an interdisciplinary perspective.
Discussion
SbD and PbD definitions lack clarity and uniformity. PbD is better defined, while SbD lacks anchorage and has varied approaches. Both should protect individuals and organizations, address cyber-attacks, and be implemented early in the development process. PbD is more comprehensive, involving technology and organization, while SbD focuses mainly on the technical product. PbD is associated with recognized rights, but the connection between SbD and human rights is unclear. Future research should clarify the specific value protected by SbD, adopt principles from PbD, and take an interdisciplinary approach.}

abstract = {This study ventures into the dynamic realm of ecosystem orchestration for industrial firms, emphasizing its significance in maintaining competitive advantage in the digital era. The fragmented research on this important subject poses challenges for firms aiming to navigate and capitalize on ecosystem orchestration. To bridge this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive qualitative meta-analysis of 31 case studies and identified multifaceted orchestration practices employed by industrial firms. The core contribution of this research is the illumination of five interdependent but interrelated orchestration practices: strategic design, relational, resource integration, technological, and innovation. Together, these practices are synthesized into an integrative framework termed the “Stirring Model,” which serves as a practical guide to the orchestration practices. Furthermore, the conceptual framework clarifies the synergy between the identified practices and highlights their collective impact. This study proposes theoretical and practical implications for ecosystem orchestration literature and suggests avenues for further research.}

abstract = {Adopting automated driving vehicles (AVs) promises to transform transportation systems, yet understanding individual preferences is essential for effective implementation. This study uses decision tree analysis to investigate the factors influencing preferences for partially automated vehicles (AV3) and fully automated vehicles (AV5). Surveys were conducted in the Duhok-Kurdistan Region of Iraq to explore attitudes toward AV technology. Respondents selected their preferred option from AV3 and AV5, with various factors considered in the analysis, including age, gender, frequency of trips, and mobility concerns. Results revealed a preference for AV3, with trip frequency emerging as a key determinant. Older respondents tended towards AV3. The number of trips was the most significant determinant in their decision-making process, with individuals who frequently traveled showing a preference for fully automated AVs. Furthermore, understanding these preferences can inform strategies for promoting AV adoption and integration into transportation systems, shaping future mobility. The study's contributions lie in its localized focus and the identification of key factors influencing AV preferences in a specific region. This insight can assist in developing tailored strategies to promote AV adoption and address mobility challenges.}
