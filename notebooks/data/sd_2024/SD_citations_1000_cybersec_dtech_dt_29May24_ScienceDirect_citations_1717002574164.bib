abstract = {The adoption of digitalization technologies in healthcare systems is crucial for improving the delivery of medical services, facilitating patient access, and enhancing the overall patient experience. However, the experience and challenges of the Saudi healthcare system in adopting digital transformation have received little attention in the literature. Thus, this chapter aims to provide an overview of the digital transformation process in the Saudi healthcare system. The authors also shed light on the major challenges and suggested technology-based solutions. This chapter was written in light of the available global and local literature discussing the digitization of the health sector. Moreover, the Saudi governmental documents and official reports were utilized to include the latest updates and future plans for the local digital transformation strategy. In paving the way toward digital transformation, many challenges have been faced in areas such as medical records unification, technical infrastructure, and workforce capability. Solutions such as telemedicine applications, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and blockchain have been gradually applied to achieve the goal of transformation by 2030. Saudi Arabia's digital transformation began in 2018, with the implementation of the Vision 2030’s rapid digital change. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, a leap in utilizing digital health solutions has been noticed locally. Nevertheless, more action plans are needed to address the challenges and implement suitable solutions accordingly.}

However, most manufacturing companies often fail to integrate these technologies within their organizational departments due to a lack of Industry 4.0 readiness assessment of the existing systems, processes, and practices. On the other hand, using Industry 4.0 readiness measures, it is possible to assess the current status of the organization to enable them to integrate and help them transition towards an Industry 4.0 mature and ready organization. Hence, this study presents a case analysis of major departments of a large integrated steel manufacturing company and identifies gaps and provides recommendations to reach towards Industry 4.0.}

abstract = {Transforming firms towards sustainability is an imperative posed by urgent environmental concerns and governmental regulations, requiring the redesign of traditionally linear and non-transparent value chains. Digital platforms can support the twin transition to digitalization and sustainability, converting the abstract into the tangible (i.e., data flows, information, and knowledge), and providing an industrial testbed to collaborate and challenge the willingness to share data, co-create and deliver value through sustainability-oriented digital services. This study presents a research collaboration with industrial actors in the context of Swedish manufacturing, aiming to showcase the potential of platforms in Swedish value chains. Awareness of the digital maturity as-is status from the individual actors within a value chain, and purposeful development strategies can lead to improved digital performance, an increased sense of collaboration and sustainable behaviour. Through a case study approach, this article illustrates the potential of digital platforms by presenting three manufacturing value chains where prioritised industrial challenges are addressed through the capabilities of such platforms: (1) a CO2 visualisation platform that allows transparency, communication and data-sharing between the stakeholders of the value chain and aims to connect different industrial partners and aims to reduce sustainability impact through collaborative efforts; (2) a collaborative root-cause analysis digital platform that allows virtual commissioning of sustainability experts, and technical support; (3) the re-development of a productivity-centred digital service into a sustainability-informing solution that provides relevant production data for SMEs, who are customers of the machine tool sector. The preliminary findings include: (1) digital maturity of individual firms in a value chain impacts the feasibility of platform development, (2) increased digital maturity allows companies to shift their focus towards sustainability priorities; most companies are often too concerned with productivity, visibility, and flexibility challenges, leaving the sustainability imperative as a nice-to-have, (3) the lack of focus on sustainability can be caused by unclear understanding of how consumer-perceived value can be captured.}

Satisfaction with TP is acceptable among both patients and professionals, the latter being the most reluctant. Diagnostic reliability has been demonstrated, but requires further studies to confirm this reliability in different diagnoses and healthcare settings. The efficacy of TP treatments is not inferior to face-to-face care, as has been proven in specific psychotherapies. Finally, it should be noted that the attitude of the psychiatrist is the most decisive element that limits or facilitates the implementation of TP.}

No wonder some analysts believe that covid-19 has contributed to fostering DT trends across industries. Yet very few studies exist about the real impact of covid-19 on DT. This study aims at filling this knowledge gap using a bibliometric analysis of 441 documents collected from the Web of Science database. Two bibliometric tools, namely Bibliometrix and VOSViewer, were used for data analysis. It emerged that impact, innovation, and performance are among the top word growth and the most relevant words, while the top three relevant affiliations are based in the USA. Further insights are presented and discussed, followed by a future research agenda.}

Mostly based on Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), they have been designed to isolate manufacturing environments without connection to cyber-infrastructures such as cloud, connectivity with offices, and other manufacturing sites. Hence, low cybersecurity protection levels make such ICS interesting for malicious cyber-attackers. Thus, resilience to such attacks through cybersecurity has become one of the most significant concerns of Industry 4.0. While the technical aspects of cybersecurity for manufacturing systems are increasingly researched, there are few published works on effective methods to train cybersecurity for manufacturing systems. This paper proposes a cybersecurity training concept that builds on teaching cybersecurity in an interactive role-based approach within a teaching factory environment. Both attack and defense strategies can be explored, and student learning performance evaluated. The concept has been implemented to show its feasibility and potential to outperform traditional classroom-based training methods.}

Discourses on “smart urbanism” are being discussed and lead to the proposal of changes to urban models and reference systems through local anchoring, a rethinking of governance, the participation of citizens, and the strengthening of their capacities (“smart citizens”). In this contribution, we observed the path of learning cities promoted by UNESCO, which, as the French examples (Clermont-Ferrand) have shown us, is decisive for the “good life”. We can see the emergence of a coexistence between “smart city” and “learning city”, which contributes to the management of urban transitions and can lead to functional complementarities and increase the capacity for adaptation and resilience. Hybridization creates tensions and controversies but also helps with regulations and coordination.

To understand the role of personalisation processes and practices across disciplines, we interviewed 10 renowned academic and industry experts to identify specific manifestations of this phenomenon, its positives and negatives, as well as its future developments. The chapter concludes by arguing that although personalisation is sold to the user as desirable, the growing awareness of the negative effects of global warming facilitates the move from person-centred consumption to a more sustainable way of life defined by the concept of society as a user.}

The situation of high environmental uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021) was adopted. The conducted research confirmed changes in digital innovation strategies in the majority of cases studied. The research showed that the tendency of companies to change their innovation strategy depends on the size of the company and the type of activity, but not on the years of operation and market scope. It was found that the innovation strategies of most companies were based on the use of modern information technologies. In this case, there is a correlation with the size of the company and market reach. The influence of variables such as the length of the company's presence on the market and the type of business activity was not confirmed. The most commonly implemented digital innovations were related to internet technologies.}

Multiple value chain configurations will exist, requiring companies to make fundamental strategic choices. As somewhat evidenced today, manufacturers will continue to link themselves directly with patients and consumers or combine with providers or even payers through vertical integration. Industry executives need to challenge conventional thinking and reimagine the roles their companies will play in 2030.

abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution or Industry 4.0 has changed today's manufacturing scenario. The need to make manufacturing systems agile, adaptive, resilient, and robust, due to the pandemic, has expediated the adoption and implementation of smart manufacturing technologies. Despite the interest of manufacturers in smart manufacturing, the adoption rate has been slow. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can be especially hindered in adoption due to the lack of a transition strategy and identification of relevant technologies required to achieve a smart factory. Although there is literature that provides maturity and readiness models and toolkits for adoption, the decision-making models for SMEs are inadequate. This paper proposes a multi-criteria decision-making model as a tool to provide a means for evaluating a large range of smart manufacturing technologies while considering the status quo for SMEs. The aim of this project is to aid SMEs in the adoption of smart manufacturing technologies by providing a roadmap to assess performance parameters and identify an appropriate smart manufacturing technology for adoption. The recommended technology is tailored to the requirements of the SME using fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The fuzzy TOPSIS technique aggregates the opinions of decision makers and uses a fuzzy environment to account for their subjectivity. The inclusion of personnel as provided by the model from various hierarchical levels promotes favourable implementation by insertion in the transition process while also educating the personnel of the technologies. An industry case study with individuals from an SME, Levil Technology, and Florida's Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) Center, FloridaMakes, is conducted to assess the preference for five smart manufacturing technologies over a range of eleven criteria pertaining to performance, sustainability, quality, cost and maintenance. The results give clarity regarding the preference for critical manufacturing criteria by assigning weightage, and identifies the most relevant technology catering to the preferred criteria. Predictive analytics for asset health monitoring was found to be most preferred followed by a digitally connected factory for visibility into production operations. The determination of rank will allow manufacturers to assess the manufacturing alternatives with respect to the key performance indicators for transition to Industry 4.0.}

Previous systematic literature reviews have considered the development of smart cities and highlighted their applications and services. However, no prior studies have comprehensively investigated smart cities in relation to emergencies. To this end, the current paper aims to provide a research agenda reviewing the relevant literature that touches on smart technologies during emergencies like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Based on a systematic methodology centred on text mining analysis, our research identified the following three themes: (a) emergency response, which covers emergency management, traffic and unmanned aerial vehicles, waste disposal, and contact tracing; (b) motivation and outcome, which includes such sub-themes as smart urbanism, quality of life and the economy; and (c) technology and data, which covers social media, machine learning, Internet of Things, data-driven applications, and object detection. We comprehensively discuss each theme and offer suggestions for future research.}

A smart grid uses advanced digital technologies, including sensors, communication networks, and analytics software, to optimize the distribution and consumption of energy in real time. The future of distributed generation is promising. As more people adopt renewable energy systems like rooftop solar panels, the demand for traditional centralized power grids will decrease. This creates opportunities for smaller, community-based microgrids that can generate and distribute energy locally. By leveraging digital technologies like Digital Twin, the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and artificial intelligence, these microgrids would improve energy efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance reliability. Overall, the combination of distributed energy generation and digital technologies has the potential to revolutionize the energy industry, making it more sustainable, resilient, and equitable. In this paper, the effective factors in the development of distributed production in the digital hybrid platform were identified and it is investigated with the cause and effect loops of the system dynamics.}

Today, digital transformation goes beyond the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to increase productivity; it is currently reaching the large population in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and has a significant impact on both work and daily life. This study aims to evaluate the GCC's various contributions to scientific publications on digital transformation, focusing on the methods used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and protect community well-being, including the most recent AI applications for COVID-19 safety measures, symptom detection, and remote healthcare. The research methodology used in this study is based on bibliometric analysis, a collection of strategies for analyzing vast amounts of bibliographic data by combining mathematical, statistical, and computer techniques. A set of publications is retrieved from three databases, Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and lens.org. Then, VOSviewer is used to extract quantitative publication metrics and visualize coexisting networks of key terms extracted during the last 5years. This study focuses on the Scopus database while the WoS and the Lens databases are left for the user as an active learning process with some research directions in exploring bibliometric analysis in healthcare and digital transformation. From 2017 to 2021, 1520 healthcare, AI, and digital transformation documents were retrieved from the Scopus database using the journals’ abstract, title, and keywords “TILE-ABS-KEY” sections. Results show that the total number of published documents in the GCC in healthcare and AI increased from 107 papers in 2017 to 720 papers in 2021. Furthermore, the number of citations jumped from 44 in 2017 to more than 4600 in 2021. The most active country was Saudi Arabia, followed by United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, and Bahrain. Three of the top five most active institutions were from Saudi Arabia—King Saud University, King Abdulaziz University, and Imam Abdulrahman University—followed by the University of Sharjah from the UAE and Qatar University. Out of the 1520 documents retrieved, 20.6% were published in medicine, 18.6% in computer science, and 9.4% in engineering. Our findings indicate that AI and healthcare research are generally well established within each country, with more advancement in Saudi Arabia and UAE, but need more collaborative research between the GCC. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the bibliometric analysis of GCC healthcare digital transformation and AI, which may help researchers, policymakers, and practitioners better understand healthcare needs and development within the GCC.}

Still, current empirical research does not yet provide ample evidence on how a firm's strategic posture towards digitalization connects to environmental performance. This study examines the link between digital orientation and environmental performance as well as the moderating role of technological turbulence. The natural-resource-based view and literature on strategic orientations provide the conceptual foundations. The hypotheses are tested with data from 515 U.S. Standard and Poor's 500 companies with 2,800 firm observations from 2009 to 2019. The results indicate that, first, a firm's digital orientation has a significant and positive effect on environmental performance and, second, this effect is even more pronounced in technologically turbulent business environments. In sum, our findings suggest that managers can improve their firm's environmental performance and competitive position by increasing the digital orientation within their organizations. We thus add to the literature on the natural-resource-based view by identifying digital orientation as a strategy aligned with the natural environment. Finally, we derive practical implications for managers and policymakers aiming to bring together digitalization and green strategies.}

By establishing and analyzing a safety risk management system model based on the BP multilayer neuron network, it provides a rationality evaluation method and design concept. After designing the safety risk management system, this paper conducts a performance test on the system. The test results show that through optimization, the accuracy, generalization ability, and reliability of the model can be improved. Its accuracy is as high as 92% or more, fully demonstrating the system's reliability and superiority!}

abstract = {Intelligent environments and intelligent government are tied together. Successful state operations supply the research, planning, legislation, coordination, and implementation necessary for intelligent environments, while intelligent environments can support government by reducing different risks posed by climate change. Making government more intelligent is difficult, however, reflecting the universality of the “uncertainty principle,” or unwanted unpredictability at the individual, organizational, political, cultural, environmental, and technical levels that complicate human efforts at social intervention. Yet, failure is not certain. By reflecting on two successful case studies of digital government—digital democracy in the former Soviet republic of Estonia and departments of motor vehicles in the United States—this chapter seeks to identify lessons for supporting intelligent environments more broadly. The chapter argues that successful governmental innovations often involve sharing the work of digitization across public and private agencies, bringing the subjects of technological innovation into the fold through financial or temporal incentives, managing modernizing projects through a distanced approach built on broad principles, and embracing technologies that are multifunctional, interoperable, and distributed. Finally, the hope for intelligent environments lies in hope itself, in embracing humanity's capacity for action at a time when the fate of the world seems so dark.}

African-based small-to-medium manufacturing enterprises (SMMEs) are yet to adopt the collaborative business manufacturing model, due to challenges associated with vagueness to new manufacturing technologies adoption. However, technological advancements have led to industry 5.0 (i5.0), which present multiple favorable opportunities for manufacturing organizations in Africa. Technology adoption was identified as a key accelerator towards sustainable manufacturing and successful implementation of sustainable development goals (SDGs). This paper aims to conscientise on the future of the manufacturing industry for an African digital economy. Adoption of new manufacturing technologies is disrupting traditional business models and creating new business models which are collaborative, and technology centered. A system of systems methodology was used to address multiple challenges affecting advancing technologies in the transport manufacturing industry in Africa. The result is a strategic system mapping for developing a cognitive manufacturing system for the transport manufacturing system.}

From a scholarly perspective, it is intriguing to observe the areas of economic activity where ICT solutions are deployed and how these solutions can contribute to the gradual transition of the economy towards sustainability. This article reports on original research aimed at individuals seeking green self-employment opportunities through the utilization of ICT. The study considers the perspective of this specific group of people and the issue of sustainable development as it discusses ICT solutions. Thus, the article identifies two interrelated, equal, and complementary objectives. The first objective is to determine the main areas where individuals seeking green self-employment use ICT solutions. The second objective is to investigate whether ICT solutions can foster the creation of green self-employment opportunities. To achieve these objectives, the study conducts a qualitative analysis of documents that describe economic activities. These documents served as the basis for applying for funding to start a business between 2019 and 2022. Specifically 603 application forms were analyzed. The study identifies key barriers to the implementation of ICT solutions in creating self-employment opportunities and highlights future implications and areas of development for ICT solutions that focus on green self-employment.}

abstract = {This study examines a disability services funding reform which produced calculative (accounting) practices to frame non-governmental organizations' (NGOs') performance and accountability, and the role of digitalization, as a form of marketization, in reframing that performance and accountability. Drawing on insights from Callon's (1998) concepts of framing and overflowing, this study analyses one NGO's pursuit of performance and accountability via calculative and digitalized forms. Through a qualitative interpretive case study approach, the study traces how new calculative practices inspired by a disability services funding reform and an online service platform act to (re)frame the NGO's accounts of performance. Analysis of this (re)framing work finds that NGO accountability is reduced by a performance object – cost management – which is supported by digitalization. Further, we find that the performativity of calculative practices constructed new forms of marketization for NGO realities, thoughts and actions, reducing the NGO services for disabled persons to economic exchanges. Our study offers insights into the counter-productive dangers of calculative practices when they generate digitalization for cost management performance objectives. In addition to marketization reframing NGO performance and accountability, concepts of framing and overflowing enable us to better understand the impact of calculations and digitalization on NGOs' service performance.}

There are initiatives in regulatory activities introducing AI algorithms as valid analytical methods, as well as published good practices to implement AI-supported processes in a number of applications (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2021). Therefore, two AI algorithms (neural networks and support vector machines) were introduced by the European Pharmacopoeia (Council of Europe, 2017) as valid chemometric methods when applied to analytical data in pharma contexts. A more recent publication elaborated by the US Food and Drug Administration described a methodology for AI application in medical devices (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2019). AI works as a multivariate mechanism to create rules and models that represent a reality described by the data generated from the analyzed system and this characteristic brings a unique opportunity to control operations along the drug life cycle.

This chapter investigates the phenomenon of autonomous vehicles (AVs), a promising new mode of mobility, and critiques it within the sustainable transport discourse. Fundamental issues plaguing society at large such as increasing air pollution, climate change, traffic congestion, lack of parking space, adverse impacts on health and wellbeing, and the rising cost of transportation, are all reasons for propelling the AV movement. The chapter critically explores opportunities and risks in environmental sustainability impinged on by autonomous mobility It concludes by elaborating on four critical urban pillars that could directly impact the successful adoption of AVs in the built environment: infrastructure, technology, customer, and policy.}

The study adopts a process centric optimization approach for a nitric acid manufacturing process. Real time and historic process data is used to develop regression models for forecasting process impact in terms of energy use, environmental emissions and production outputs. Four regression models are developed: NO2 production, nitric acid production, total NOx emissions and the energy balance of the manufacturing process compressor train. The robustness of the four models is compared to the virtual process; overall, the average error of the combined models is 17.5% with the energy balance model proving to be the most robust. Applying the regression models allows the organization to optimize operations while adhering to environmental regulations and maintaining commercial competitiveness.}

As labor and suppliers shift to digital platforms, interconnection, information transparency, and decentralized choices become ubiquitous. In this sense, Industry 4.0 enables "smart digitalization" in these environments. Many applications exist in two distinct but interrelated areas related to shipbuilding design and shipyard operational performance. New digital tools, such as virtual prototypes and augmented reality, begin to be used in the design phases, during the commissioning/quality control activities, and for training workers and crews. An application relates to using Virtual Prototypes and Augmented Reality during all the design and construction phases. Another application relates to the cybersecurity protection of operational networks that support shipbuilding supply chains that ensures the flow of material and labor to the shipyards. This protection requires a holistic approach to evaluate their vulnerability and understand ripple effects. This paper presents the applications of Industry 4.0 for the areas mentioned above. The first case in shipbuilding design is an example of how the virtual prototype of a ship, together with wearable devices enabling augmented reality, can be used for the quality control of the construction of ship systems. For the second case, we propose developing an artificial intelligence-based cybersecurity supply network framework that characterizes and monitors shipbuilding supply networks and determines ripple effects from disruptions caused by cyberattacks. This framework extends a novel risk management framework developed by Diaz and Smith and Smith and Diaz that considers complex tiered networks.}

However, protecting personal and digital health passport information during a crisis is challenging. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an agent-based secure decentralized innovative digital health passport protocol that is interoperable, fault-tolerant, and compatible with privacy standards. The proposed solution is known as Secure Mobile Digital Passport Agent (SMDPA), uses: (1) Private Set Intersection (PSI) to (a) protect Digital Health Passport Information (DHPA) against surveillance, especially during the crisis, (b) generate Bit Passing Coin (BPC); (2) blockchain to store serialized SMDPAs copies (3) mobile agent to disseminate DHPA autonomously; (4) Location and time attributes for data minimization. We prototype the proposed solution using the JADE agent framework. The performance measurements show that the result is acceptable.}

To meet this demand, global average rack power density has risen from 2.4 kW/rack in 2011 to 8.4 kW/rack in 2020 with the aid of technological advancements. About 36% of global data centers have racks above 30 kW/rack. Average Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) dropped from 2.5 in 2007 to 1.65 in 2013, but has been almost flat since then, at 1.59 in 2020. The depletion of finite fossil fuel reservoirs, adverse impact of greenhouse gas emissions on global warming, recyclability of electronic waste, and the rising cost of energy are pushing the datacom industry toward more energy-efficient and sustainable technologies including renewable energy, highly efficient electronics cooling, waste heat recovery, passive cooling systems, and energy storage, which are broadly reviewed in this paper. Use of renewable energy resources through power purchase agreements rose by 346% from 2.4 GW in 2017 to 10.7 GW in 2020. Air-side economizers can reduce PUE by 30–50% and water-side economizers by 10–30%. The server/rack outlet is an ideal spot for waste heat recovery and can be coupled with a multi-stage heat pump to save significant energy if coupled to a district heating system. Active and passive deployment of thermal energy storage can save more than 20% of cooling energy and reduce temperature fluctuations by more than 60%. Edge computing, decentralization, and virtualization can lead to lower latency, higher scalability, and reliability during failure.}

The amount of personal data generated by every media-active individual is staggering, and it comes to define that person's online presence. What is even more overwhelming is users' powerlessness when it comes to navigating and making sense of the various privacy policies attached to every webpage they open for the first time. This brings into question the notion of informed consent when subscribing to a new online service or making a purchase; how ‘informed’ can it be? Despite recently introduced data protection laws in Europe and the United States, users remain vulnerable to online threats including misinformation and misuse of personal data, which can negatively affect their lives. This chapter outlines these current issues and explores public attitudes concerning data management in social networking sites, and the possible links between data harvesting and digital wellbeing. Following evaluation of the current landscape, we offer potential solutions, suggesting social media platforms could encompass person-centred design to resolve the issues identified.}

abstract = {The key issues of functional safety of railway systems of control and management of train movement are considered. The standard requirements for the completeness of safety are given, and the safety states and the principles of its provision in safety-related systems are described. The effectiveness of the application of these principles depends to a large extent on the available time resource. Models have been developed to significantly improve the accuracy of determining the permissible detection time of a dangerous failure in comparison with the well-known formulas of V. Shvir and S. Shvir. Adomit (for single and double failure detection, respectively). The article analyzes the experience of the UIC member countries in the development of modern microprocessor systems in railway transport. In the context of digital transformation, it is expected to accelerate the introduction of a number of innovative solutions. These include widespread use of commercial products (COTS); standardization of architecture, interfaces, and open source software for system development and testing; application of fundamentally new scientific solutions that will correctly and reliably predict the risks in the operation of railway control systems and, on this basis, quickly and flexibly rebuild these systems to ensure the required levels of their functional safety and reliability. The goal of the digital transformation of the traffic safety management system is to move to a global level of interaction with the processes of all departments for the integrated assessment of the risk of possible events and the achievement of established indicators. The capabilities of Big Data technology allow you to use data on a variety of different factors to predict the risks of dangerous failures associated with the security of microprocessor control systems. The results of the predictive analysis of dangerous failures on Russian railways are presented. During 2019–20, Data Science artificial intelligence algorithms were developed and dynamic models for categorizing safety-related railway automation and telemechanics systems were studied. They are designed to identify, evaluate, predict, process, and monitor early warning indicators of risk factors in relation to such systems. Testing of these models was carried out on the Gorky, Severnaya, and Kuibyshev Russian Railways. According to the results of forecasting, the best results for microprocessor automation and telemechanics systems were shown by the use of the artificial intelligence algorithm “binary decision tree” (89.9% and 87%, respectively, of the convergence of the forecast of a dangerous failure and the fact of its presence). Converting the source object into a system with digital doubles can significantly reduce the intensity of dangerous failures. This chapter presents the results of a study of the use of digital doubles in the control system. The results are encouraging. At the same time, this is a new approach to system safety that has not yet been tested. Naturally, it requires a thorough safety justification.}

The influence of e-leadership on organizational performance is assumed to be mediated by work engagement, employees’ dynamic capabilities, work motivation, P-J fit and job performance. The theoretical model is verified by empirical research performed among 1160 organizations operating in Poland, Italy and USA during an active wave of COVID-19 pandemic. The obtained results confirmed the proposed hypotheses, allowing to conclude that e-leadership activates work engagement of employees, who are more willing to use their dynamic capabilities to shape work motivation and reestablish P-J fit, which in turn influences positively job and organizational performance.}

The chapter begins with considering the emerging high-level consensus descriptions of the future system model with its structural pillars (data, well-being, and integration) and features (AI, ambient, and collaborative). It then “fleshes” out the details of this form through the system's function, expressed as resilient integration driving health ecosystem operations: Data+well-being=Efficiency+equity. The chapter then seeks to demonstrate how the major structural elements of the future's health ecosystem (precision medicine, public health, telehealth, and safety) and their societal contextual elements (political economics and ethics) can be optimally arranged as “complementary ecosystem base pairs” in the system DNA above, with their double-helix “backbone” being the reality of each patient as a person in community with other persons, understood from a consensus-based pluralistic standpoint. It then seeks to illustrate this final conceptual framework in practical emerging cases including AI-powered well-being (in its global, strategic, and structural aspects), maturing enterprise-wide AI-powered healthcare (in its local, operational, and functional aspects), and emerging transformation trends (including dignity-security moral interoperability, strategic empathy, adaptive empowerment networks, embedded clinical trials, digital twins, quantum health, and liquid AI in cloud electronic health records). The chapter concludes by proposing how modern value-based healthcare systems can transform through efficient and ethical AI to become the future's thinking healthcare system operating as optimized health ecosystems in the global digital ecosystem that is self-aware, self-adaptive, and other-serving, with artificial intelligence integrated with human compassion, worthy of the patients it serves.}

Different aspects of smart city assessment tools including scale of assessment, target groups, type of data, source of data, and geographical focus are studied. It is discussed that major approaches to assessment include benchmarking, baseline assessment, maturity assessment, assessment against peers, assessment against desirable targets, and scenario making. Currently, benchmarking is the most popular approach. However, depending on the specific needs of a development, other approaches may also be used to better inform decision making toward climate resilient cities. It is discussed that smart city should be evaluated at different levels and dimensions. There are six dimensions to cover all aspects of smart city including smart economy, smart people, smart mobility, smart governance, smart living, smart data. Different indicators related to these dimensions are provided that can inform planners and policy makers in their efforts. The chapter argues that smart city assessment tools should be able to facilitate transition toward climate resilience. In this regard, our analysis showed that existing assessment tools are relatively suitable for informing planning and policy making related to environmental and social dimensions. However, better integration of issues and indicators related to other dimensions such as infrastructure is needed. We hope these will be further investigated in the future research.}

This paper presents a tertiary study of thirty-two literature reviews on Industry 5.0, supported by a bibliometric analysis in the Scopus database. The results show three stages of Industry 5.0 research since 2018, starting with the Industry 4.0 separation. The latest priority is to deploy circular manufacturing strategies supported by human-friendly digitalization capable of anticipating and acting proactively on impacts. Therefore, Industry 5.0 is future-oriented and cross-sectoral, (interactively) diverging from the original configuration of Industry 4.0. For theory, we highlight the findings of recent literature reviews, clarifying the landscape of Industry 5.0 research and suggesting future developments. For practice, this paper presents examples of societal priorities that industries should consider in their digital transformation investments, as crucial as improving economic competitiveness.}

Then the digital censorship tools in the five case study countries are documented to examine where their governments’ tactics overlapped with those of the Kremlin and Beijing. These case study countries differ in their levels of development and democracy, with Russia, China, and the West all vying for influence.

abstract = {Industry 4.0, often known as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), offers manufacturing businesses tremendous financial prospects and challenges. In this empirical study (based on an inductive qualitative research approach), we combined a literature review and an expert interview to look at the latest advancements in emerging technologies for manufacturing transformation and the requirements and approaches that manufacturing firms in emerging economies must employ to complete this transformation. Based on our findings, we developed a thorough overview of factors associated with IIoT and identified areas for additional study to contribute to the IIoT transformation agenda. The results of this study can guide stakeholders, particularly managers of manufacturing businesses and researchers. The literature study results posit state-of-the-art studies on how the implementation of IIoT technologies can drive the transformation of manufacturing businesses in emerging economies.}

abstract = {Digitalization permeates conversations about society's future—ever since the 1980s when the informatization of the economy also emerged as popular urban development theme. The promises and realities of digital innovation have come to suffuse everything from government to finance, art to medicine, astronomy to cities, politics to warfare—and from genetics to reality itself. This astonishing advance presents enormous opportunities and risks. It carries with it great responsibilities. Digital systems augmenting physical space, buildings, and cities occupy a special place in the wider evolutionary discourse about advanced technology. Elsevier's two Intelligent Environments books edited by Peter Droege span a quarter of a century across this genre. This second volume goes a step further than the first and asks: how does civilization approach thinking systems, and more specifically intelligent spatial models, design methods, and support structures that are designed or applied for spatial sustainability, in ways that could even counteract current challenges to terrestrial habitability? The result of this quest is useful, practical, and informative: it opens a door to what must now become a rapidly growing and overarching existential focus. This book presents a range of practical, typical, systemic but also unusual and even sublime ideas and initiatives to regenerate a sustainable world freed from the dogma of development without purpose. These are visible in endeavors as diverse as the planned guidance of industrial change across regions, currency innovation, infrastructure architecture, network protocols of energy transaction, geodesign, net-positive design, remote work, integrated transport—or notions of artificial intelligence in understanding our most immediate spatial setting: the human body.}

Although there are few differences between green energy and renewable energy, it is derived from regenerative energy sources. These energy sources don't harm the environment by, for example, releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. In fact, blockchain is expected to drastically change the renewable energy sector in a number of ways, including certifying the source of green energy by assigning generation assets to a particular point of consumption, increasing accessibility to energy grids through real-time data sharing, and facilitating a transaction between two parties (n.d.). Blockchain technology has the potential to change green finance in light of the pressing need for climate solutions and the importance of transparency and traceable data in measurement and monitoring.}

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are impacting an increasingly broad range of aspects of life, bringing widespread and rapid change. One consequence of this is that engineering work is becoming open-ended, requiring a new kind of collaboration between engineers and technology. The present chapter argues that this will be based on “capability-focused technology fluency” (CFTF). Technology fluency (TF) requires domain-specific expertise; capability focus (CF), by contrast, involves a general (i.e., not engineering-specific) mindset based on two “metacompetencies”: willingness and ability to update your own knowledge, on the one hand, and willingness and ability to use this knowledge to work effectively with rapid change, novelty and uncertainty, on the other. Developing an understanding of this capability focus is the task of “cyber-psychology” and supporting a “dual-track” approach, which encompasses the growth of not only (technology fluency) TF but of (capability focus) CF as well, is now an important task for engineering organizations preparing for the future of work.}

abstract = {As the pressure for companies to advance towards the Industry 4.0 paradigm increases, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) still lack financial and human resources. Therefore, research should investigate how SMEs can digitalize their business operations. Through a literature review, three focus areas of digitalization in SMEs are determined: IT infrastructure, data collection and analysis, and prototyping. In combination with these, the previous literature shows that SMEs should innovate using their existing resources, consider the feasibility of their existing data, and optimize their IT infrastructure to improve their digital maturity. Moreover, companies should be able to develop their maintenance strategy by increasing their data maturity. Therefore, this paper investigates how a case company can use existing IT systems and data to advance its maintenance strategy. The results from the case study conclude that companies can indeed improve some of their maintenance activities by innovating using their existing IT infrastructure and data.}

Results reveal that there would be enormous gains from complete adoption of AI across the world. Australia, China, and USA would gain the most. Countries that experience data theft and cybersecurity crimes, for example, Argentina, Brazil, USA, and Germany, experience higher losses. As against the conventional argument that automation could lower employment rates, the model estimates a rise in employment of skilled labor.}

However, these efforts may be seriously hampered by the lack of available human resources with the necessary skills and competencies to develop, implement, and use HIE networks. Different types of professionals with complementary skills are needed to both maintain a region or country’s HIE network and optimally use the health data contained therein. These human resources include health information technology, health informatics, and health information management professionals, which includes HIE. These individuals possess not only the knowledge of information and communications technologies but also the knowledge of the health system, data standards and interoperability across platforms, privacy and security of health records, human factors and process engineering, project management, change management and technology adoption, information governance, and data analytics. This chapter will outline the human resources needed, their roles, competencies, and training, to put an effective HIE network in place and ensure that quality data are available for health system use and improvement.}

Financial institutions are the backbone of the economy. Due to this last the impact of cyber-attacks against the financial institutions can have very severe effects. We will examine the increase of cyber-attack vectors financial institutions are facing, the methods of attack most used by cybercriminals. The impact of COVID-19 and large-scale attacks are huge topics; thus, we will only analyze their direct impact on the financial institutions. We will review the possible cyber security measures: strategies and DLT as a possible solution against cyber threats. Finally, we will touch the topic of cyberwarfare.}

IoT and Smart Cities, are in permanent mutation and evolution, towards a new paradigm of digitalization and digital transformation. The existing literature review exposes much of the attention that is given to IoT, but a broad discussion on the characteristics, use, applications, and challenges of these technologies in Smart Cities is still needed. The main contribution of this paper is that it provides a systematic assessment and synthesis of the critical applications and challenges of IoT, in the development of Smart Cities.}
