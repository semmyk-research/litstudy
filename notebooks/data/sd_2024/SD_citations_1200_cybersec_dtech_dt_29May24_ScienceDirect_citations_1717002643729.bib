abstract = {ABSTRACT
Dynamic changes in the global economy, resulting from the implementation of the Industry 4.0 concept, cover practically all areas of life. They mainly concern companies that need to adapt to these changes as soon as possible in order to face growing competition. The digitalization process is of great significance in this respect, as it requires having appropriate material and personal resources as well as knowledge necessary to implement new innovative solutions. Problems associated with the digitalization of economy are very well understood in the European Union (EU), which makes every effort to ensure the best possible conditions for the implementation of this process in companies in all member states. A special group of these countries belong to Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), the youngest members of the EU. Given this extremely important issue, the paper presents the results of research on the level of digitalization of small, medium and large enterprises in this group of countries (CEE). Their aim was to evaluate the level of digitalization of the studied groups of enterprises and individual CEE countries. It was important to determine digital technologies dominating in particular groups of enterprises and, with the use of non-parametric tests, the influence of the digitalization level on selected economic parameters of particular CEE countries. The research was based on 11 selected indicators characterizing the digital technologies used, infrastructure for Industry 4.0 and personnel training in new technologies. The level of digitalization of individual groups of companies was determined based on the multi-criteria decision-making method (MCDM). In this case, the TOPSIS and VIKOR methods were applied, for which the rankings and levels of digitalization of individual CEE countries were also determined. The entropy and CRITIC methods were utilized to measure the weights of indicators adopted for the study. The whole research was complemented by statistical analyses of the adopted indicators. The results showed a high differentiation in the level of digitalization for individual CEE countries and the studied groups of enterprises. The highest levels of digitalization were reported in Slovenia, Croatia and the Czech Republic. The lowest levels were reported in Bulgaria and Romania. From the point of view of the size of enterprises, the highest levels of digitalization were found in the group of large enterprises, which results from their potential and resources. The results are an important source of information regarding the current state of digitalization in the CEE countries, considering the size of enterprises. This, in turn, should be used when developing strategies for the digital transformation of the CEE countries and the entire EU.}

Bringing together acceleration processes and spatial scale dynamics, this study highlights the potential for electricity distribution to play a keystone role in the energy transition. We present and examine survey data of electricity distribution utilities in a region of the U.S. to show how trends in decentralization and digitization are intertwined with decarbonization. These trends rebalance economic value toward distribution networks and away from centralized infrastructure. The survey data show that electricity distribution organizations are deploying local, renewable generation projects that produce electricity for one-third (1/3) less than the cost from a centralized generation-and-transmission entity. We suggest that this change and others are likely to transform distribution operators into more broad-based local power organizations. Although the cost advantage of distributed generation seemingly marks a future of local control and decentralized organizational forms, spatial scale dynamics indicate countervailing centralization trends, including that distribution networks may evolve to dependency on external digital, engineering, and capital providers. The outcome of the resulting conflicts will affect the potential for transition acceleration to be enabled or reduced.}

Using a sample of firms from the Fortune 500 list from 2015 to 2019, the findings show that digital reputation positively impacts a firm's financial and non-financial performance. Furthermore, results reveal that breadth (the variety of SDG-related themes covered) and concentration (the distribution of non-financial disclosure among the SDGs) operate as moderators in the above relationship. On the other hand, depth (the total volume of the SDG-based information) appears not to be significant.

The convergence of information technology, media, and telecommunications has altered consumer behavior in terms of searching, obtaining, processing, and responding to a company’s information or services. The ability of a company to plan, implement, and manage digital marketing to increase its competitiveness in the eyes of consumers is referred to as digital marketing capability. This research presents a digital marketing utilization index (DMUI) to evaluate and improve a company’s digital marketing capability. DMUI is made up of three components: the innovation ecosystem readiness, the adoption of digital marketing technology, and the company’s digital transformation. Based on data from 217 companies in Indonesia, the results show that the DMUI of companies in Indonesia has an average of 71.97, indicating that the level of digital marketing capabilities of companies in Indonesia is in the medium category. They can improve their digital marketing capabilities by increasing the role of managerial innovativeness, organizational readiness, and perceived usefulness. Furthermore, businesses must carry out digital transformation by governing the transformation and reinvention of new business models. Finally, in addition to implementing digital marketing via websites, social media, mobile marketing, and content marketing, they must emphasize the importance of digital analytics, digital CRM, digital advertising, and display advertising to improve their company’s digital marketing capabilities.}

This deployment generates a significant amount of data that could be used to promote energy efficiency, new energy services and market transparency. However, the use of this data has not yet reached the majority of the final users or other stakeholders due to either lack of data interoperability between the different agents in the system and the lack of regulation regarding the share and use of the data. In parallel, the EU regulated the use of personal data through the General Data Protection Regulation. The enforcement of this regulation resulted in the use of data in the energy sector becoming even more difficult. However, the need to make energy data useful for end-users to promote their participation in the system and become more efficient and active agents still exists. This paper looks into the Portuguese national framework and the European regulations and policies in data and energy and then proposes a new regulatory framework that could cope with all the aforementioned constraints for the Portuguese Electric System}

However, the use of AI in public administration is riddled with ethical tensions of fairness, transparency, privacy, and human rights. We call these AI tensions. The current literature lacks a contextual and processual understanding of AI adoption and diffusion in public administration to be able to explore such tensions. Previous studies have outlined risks, benefits, and challenges with the use of AI in public administration. However, a large gap remains in understanding AI tensions as they relate to public value creation. Through a systematic literature review grounded in public value management and the resource-based view of the firms, we identify technology-organisational-environmental (TOE) contextual variables and absorptive capacity as factors influencing AI adoption as discussed in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that outlines distinct AI tensions from an AI implementation and diffusion perspective within public administration. We develop a future research agenda for the full AI innovation lifecycle of adoption, implementation, and diffusion.}

abstract = {The exponential increase in data produced over the last two decades has revolutionized the way we collect, store, process, analyze, model, and interpret information to improve profitability. Manufacturing is no exception. However, Smart Manufacturing, the digital practice, organization, workforce, and infrastructure transformation for collection and deployment of data and models at scale and at all levels of manufacturing, is a complex, costly, and labor-intensive journey that is still seeing slow adoption. The Clean Energy Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute (CESMII), a national Manufacturing USA public-private partnership sponsored by the Department of Energy, is addressing this scaled use of data and modeling in manufacturing. CESMII has focused on how to collect and use operating data for numerous applications that improve productivity, precision, and performance of manufacturing operations from factory floor to supply chain using process simulation, predictive analytics, monitoring and control, and real-time optimization. Because contextualized data are key, CESMII has developed the Smart Manufacturing Innovation Platform (SMIP) to lower the barriers to the data that are needed to accelerate data-based model building, improve data visualization, and more quickly gain insights. Reusable, standards-based ways of doing data collection, ingestion, and contextualization are particularly important for scaling access and use of data. The SMIP uses a standards-based definition and construct for reusable information models called an SM Profile. When an SM Profile is used in conjunction with the SMIP, the SMIP ensures the availability of contextualized, operational data for model building. The present work demonstrates Smart Manufacturing and the application of the SMIP for building several data-centered models for the operation and control of an experimental electrochemical reactor that reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) gas to valuable liquid and gas chemicals, such as alcohols, olefins, and syngas. We describe how the SMIP plays a central role in more effective model building and we demonstrate how the electochemical reactor can be controlled and optimized for the desired products. Use of the SMIP involves the transmission of real-time sensor measurements to a cloud resource so that the operating data are available to all model building experts. The data collection and transmission process is fully automated to greatly reduce the need for manual manipulation of the data. Data-driven machine learning models are used for advanced real-time state estimation, real-time optimization, and model-based feedback control for the reactor. The application models are implemented as a system to monitor the data flow and control the electrochemical reactor with a single visualization interface. SM Profiles are used to demonstrate reusability of the information models for the reactor and the instrumentation. The application packages, algorithms, and user interfaces developed are cast as Docker images in a library to facilitate reusability of the application models.}

Wireless communication protocols constitute a critical part of smart agriculture systems because the fields, in general, cover a large area requiring system components to be placed at distant locations. There are various communication protocols with different features that can be utilized in smart agriculture applications. When designing a smart agriculture system, it is required to carefully consider the features of possible protocols to make a suitable and optimal selection. Therefore, this review paper aims to underline the specifications of the wireless communication protocols that are widely used in smart agriculture applications. Furthermore, application-specific requirements, which may be useful during the design stage of the smart agriculture systems, are highlighted. To accomplish these aims, this paper compares the technical properties and investigates the practical applications of five different wireless communication protocols that are commonly used in IoT applications: ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, NB-IoT, and LoRaWAN. In particular, the inconsistencies in the technical properties of these protocols reported in different resources have been highlighted and the reason for this situation has been discussed. Considering the features offered by the protocols and the requirements of smart agriculture applications, the appropriateness of a particular protocol to a particular smart agriculture application is examined. In addition, issues about cost, communication quality, and hardware of the five protocols have been mentioned. The trending technologies with high potential for the future applications of smart agriculture have been introduced. In this context, the relation of the technologies like aerial systems, cellular communication, and big data analytics with wireless have been specified. Finally, the leading protocol and the smart agriculture application area have been highlighted through observing the year-based distribution of the recent publications. It has been shown that usage of LoRaWAN protocol has become more widespread in recent years.}

Women’s Healthcare Australasia (WHA) data from 2020-21 indicate that 14.2% of women in public hospitals experience a vaginal birth after primary caesarean section (VBAC), and the average success rate for VBAC-eligible women who attempted vaginal birth was only 33%. Townsville University Hospital is a tertiary (level 6) hospital located in North Queensland. The above rates in our institution are 25.1% (overall VBAC rate) and 63.5% (VBAC success rate; highest of WHA hospitals for this period). Ten years ago, our VBAC rate was lower than the national average. Healthcare is a complex system, and a single healthcare improvement strategy is often not enough to lead to tangible improvements in our maternity system. Our organisation has been on a journey of improvement through collaborative antenatal education by midwives and obstetricians, a community focus on VBAC, implementation of Midwifery Group Practice teams to enhance choice after primary caesarean and midwifery and medical education to normalise VBAC in our unit. In this presentation, we will describe factors believed to have contributed to the reversal of the trend of intervention and postulate implications for other maternity interventions. These factors relate broadly to consumer-centred care, antenatal education, continuity of care, community engagement, collaborative practice, leadership, and intrapartum strategies for success.}

The study adopts a systematic review of studies in this domain and their subsequent analysis against a CCA framework. Most applications were found to be centered on two CCA functions; the financial management, and the document and record management. CCA functions that embed complex contractual logics such as claims and disputes resolution management have received scant attention. To advance blockchain application in CCA, a structured roadmap of its key challenges relating to technology, process, policy and society is proposed for future research.

While many pilot projects have provided proof-of-concept information on CDSS efficacy, they encompass disparate systems unable to fully realise digital transformation. A lack of system-wide guidance on CDSS integration limits the efficacy of even technically well-positioned systems. The objective of this study was to identify challenges and opportunities relating to CDSS implementation in Australia.
Methods
Opting for a qualitative approach, we purposefully sampled at national and state levels policymakers involved in CDSS implementation in Australia. We completed 11 semi-structured interviews from March to June 2020. The data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.
Results
The Australian digital health landscape for CDSS implementation appears to be fragmented, characterised by a lack of integration between clinical and technological elements. This fragmentation is exacerbated by the lack of a shared understanding and collaboration between key stakeholders, increasing the risk of conflicting interests. CDSS are usually designed for a particular clinical workflow, and a lack of interoperability reduces the information flow between systems. Most efforts to achieve data standardisation are limited to organisational or state-level programs, thus increasing the risk of uncoordinated care across organisations. Considering different stakeholder perspectives on the value of CDSS could help to foster sustainable partnerships between governments, organisations, and consumers.
Conclusion
Our findings emphasise the importance of three things, each underpinned by stakeholder engagement: developing a clear and shared vision for innovation, building clinicians’ skills and organisational capacity for change, and establishing a national consensus on data standards for interoperable CDSS.}

To guarantee an adequate combination of these technologies, several maturity models have been proposed in the literature, but only a few papers have investigated the actual implementation paths adopted by firms for digital transformation. In particular, no studies have investigated the implementation paths followed by SMEs, whose limited financial and human resources may prevent the adoption of the roadmaps developed for large firms. In this paper, we analyse the implementation paths for digital transformation adopted by a wide sample of Italian SMEs operating in different sectors. By combining Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling with Necessity Condition Analysis, we clarify the specific enabler and enhancer roles played by different digital technologies. The study sheds further light on the relationship among these technologies and their contribution to the development of SMEs’ information processing capability. In particular, our analysis shows that digital technologies associated with Industry 4.0 can be classified into four hierarchical layers, Sensor, Integration, Intelligence, and Response, that are in charge of the collection, combination, processing and use of organizational data. Our results show that the implementation of these layers is not based on a standalone approach since the lower layers enable and enhance the adoption of the upper layers. The present paper may also offer useful insights to managers and policymakers, interested in improving the digital transformation of SMEs.}

abstract = {Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the growth of digital health tools. Although a number of different tools exist to support field data collection in the context of outbreak response, they have not been sufficient. This prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to collaborate with the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and GOARN partners to develop a comprehensive system, Go.Data. Go.Data, a digital tool for outbreak response has simplified how countries operationalize and monitor case and contact data. Since the start of the pandemic, WHO and GOARN partners have provided support to Go.Data projects in 65 countries and territories, yet the demand by countries to have documented success cases of Go.Data implementations continues to grow. This viewpoint documents the successful Go.Data implementation frameworks in two countries, Argentina and Guatemala and an academic institution, the University of Texas at Austin.}

Traditionally, food quality is determined using a range of destructive and time-consuming approaches with modest analytical performance, underscoring the urgent need to develop novel analytical techniques. The Fourth Industrial Revolution (called Industry 4.0) is progressing exponentially, driven by the advent of a range of digital technologies and other innovative technological advances. “Food Quality 4.0” is a new concept referring to the use of Industry 4.0 technologies in food analysis to achieve rapid, reliable, and objective assessment of food quality. In this review, we will first discuss the fundamentals and principles of Food Industry 4.0 technologies and their connections with the Food Quality 4.0 concept. Then, the most common techniques used to determine food quality will briefly be reviewed before highlighting the advancements made in analytical techniques to assess food quality in the era of Industry 4.0. Food Quality 4.0 is characterized by growing digitalization and automation of food analysis using the most advanced technologies in the food industry. Key aspects of Food Quality 4.0, including, among others, non-destructive fingerprinting techniques, omics technologies and bioinformatics tools, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, have great potential to revolutionize food quality. Although most of these technologies are still under development, it is anticipated that future research will overcome current limitations for large-scale applications.}

abstract = {In the supply chain, companies are increasingly relying on the combination of internal knowledge creation and external knowledge resources to form a new “open innovation” approach. How to govern inter-organizational relationships (IOR) is a key determinant of knowledge creation, which involves both formal contracts and relationship behaviors. Formal contracts determine the roles and obligations of partners in the exchange, and relationship behavior is generated by mutual benefit from the exchange of various resources. Moreover, when the knowledge creation process requires partners to exchange knowledge, supply chain technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud-computing based advanced communication services are key in promoting the partners’ willingness to communicate. Therefore, this study uses the governance mechanism of the supply chain as a theoretical framework, and proposes an innovative and complete research model to explore the factors that influence open innovation capability in supply chains. PLS is used to analyze 140 samples collected from 600 organizations, the response rate is 23.3%. This study finds that supply chain technology has a stronger effect than both of the IOR issues, contractual governance and relational governance, for the exchange of tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge. The findings improve our understanding on how governance mechanism and technology drive the knowledge creation process towards open innovation success in the context of supply chains.}

In addition to gender, the generational gap and behavioral tendency should be taken into consideration to improve employee acceptance rates.}

This study draws upon the technology-organisation-environment framework and resource-based view theory to propose an integrated model that examines the drivers and impact of BDA adoption in the retail industry in Jordan. The proposed single model encapsulates the aspects of BDA adoption and performance. The study makes use of an online questionnaire survey to collect the required data, and the research model is eventually validated based on 132 responses gathered from the retail industry in Jordan. The findings highlight two major observations. The first is that relative advantage, organisational readiness, top management support, government support, data variety and data velocity all have a significant influence over BDA adoption. The second observation is that a significant association exists between BDA adoption and firm performance, providing information on the way firms can enhance their BDA adoption for enhanced performance. This study contributes to literature dedicated to examining BDA in terms of its drivers and impact on performance and can be used as a reference in developing nations.}

In this paper, we survey the existing literature on XSS attacks, focusing on the range of attacks and potential mitigation strategies. Specifically, we review the various XSS attacks from the lens of an attacker. We use a workflow diagram to define the topological relationship among XSS attacks, and to highlight key system weaknesses (e.g., chokepoints). We also present a Hybrid XSS attack (HYXSSA), designed to facilitate the identification of existing and future potential attack vectors in different modalities presented as frameworks (fi). For quantification and visualization of these frameworks, the software application as a rotate view tool is developed. Moreover, we demonstrate how these derived frameworks can be implemented, and provide a guideline to defend against XSS attacks. The implementation results for the given two attack vector shows the feasibility of mapping of attack vectors to actual mathematical vectors.

abstract = {This study analyzed the Coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis from the angle of cyber-crime,highlighting the wide spectrum of cyberattacks that occurred around the world. The modus operandi of cyberattack campaigns was revealed by analyzing and considering cyberattacks in the context of major world events. Following what appeared to be substantial gaps between the initial breakout of the virus and the first COVID-19-related cyber-attack, the investigation indicates how attacks became significantly more frequent over time, to the point where three or four different cyber-attacks were reported on certain days. This study contributes in the direction of fifteen types of cyber-attacks which were identified as the most common pattern and its ensuing devastating events during the global COVID-19 crisis. The paper is unique because it covered the main types of cyber-attacks that most organizations are currently facing and how to address them. An intense look into the recent advances that cybercriminals leverage, the dynamism, calculated measures to tackle it, and never-explored perspectives are some of the integral parts which make this review different from other present reviewed papers on the COVID-19 pandemic. A qualitative methodology was used to provide a robust response to the objective used for the study. Using a multi-criteria decision-making problem-solving technique, many facets of cybersecurity that have been affected during the pandemic were then quantitatively ranked in ascending order of severity. The data was generated between March 2020 and December 2021, from a global survey through online contact and responses, especially from different organizations and business executives. The result show differences in cyber-attack techniques; as hacking attacks was the most frequent with a record of 330 out of 895 attacks, accounting for 37%. Next was Spam emails attack with 13%; emails with 13%; followed by malicious domains with 9%. Mobile apps followed with 8%, Phishing was 7%, Malware 7%, Browsing apps with 6%, DDoS has 6%, Website apps with 6%, and MSMM with 6%. BEC frequency was 4%, Ransomware with 2%, Botnet scored 2% and APT recorded 1%. The study recommends that it will continue to be necessary for governments and organizations to be resilient and innovative in cybersecurity decisions to overcome the current and future effects of the pandemic or similar crisis, which could be long-lasting. Hence, this study's findings will guide the creation, development, and implementation of more secure systems to safeguard people from cyber-attacks.}

This article introduces the requirements and specification of CINNAMON in a differential fashion with respect to the existing Secure Onboard Communication Basic Software Module, which does not include confidentiality. As a result, CINNAMON exceeds SecOC at least against information gathering attacks. The article then defines three security profiles, regulating also the freshness attribute appropriately. Most importantly, CINNAMON is not a simple academic exercise because it is implemented in a laboratory environment on commercial ECUs, thus reaching the level of TRL 4, “Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment”. The runtimes obtained on inexpensive devices are reassuring, paving the way for a possible large-scale application.}

The results of event studies show that the announcement of digital M&As leads to a rise in the short- and medium-term market value of acquiring enterprises, especially the short-term effect is statistically significant. Further multivariate analyses, which employ a difference-in-differences (DID) strategy and propensity score matching (PSM) techniques, provide causal evidence that digital M&As have a positive market value effect on acquirers, which is greater than that of non-digital M&As. This effect survives a vast array of robustness checks and displays some heterogeneity. Finally, we further verify two underlying channels (i.e., innovation and analyst coverage) through which digital M&As achieve market value creation.}

Despite the lack of legislation, development of autonomous and remote fleets is ongoing and as a result the new role of a Remote Operator has emerged. A Remote Operator is expected to be responsible for the safe navigation of an autonomous vessel remotely, either through monitoring or controlling the vessel from a Remote Operations Centre. Current Deck Officers are expected to transition to this new role, however the skills and training required to make the transition has not yet been identified. This thesis investigates the transition of skills and training from Deck Officer to Remote Operator, by identifying a Remote Operator skillset and skill gaps. Further investigation is conducted into the perception of autonomous and remote shipping among qualified Deck Officers and what opportunities and barriers they foresee. The project evaluates data from research conducted so far, specialist interviews and a Deck Officer Questionnaire. From the data collected Remote Operators will need a collection of seafaring experience, situational awareness and safety awareness to support the new role. Deck Officers opinions from the questionnaire were split between opportunity and threat, with many concerned for job loss but support the modernisation of the maritime industry. This investigation highlights the key role humans, in particular Deck Officers, will play in partnership with new technology and the importance of ensuring the work force is ‘future proof’.}

However, little has been done to understand how this ill-defined phenomenon may deliver its indented sustainability values despite these speculative promises. To address this knowledge gap, the present study developed a strategy roadmap that explains the mechanism by which Industry 5.0 delivers its intended sustainable development functions. The study first developed and introduced the Industry 5.0 reference model that describes the technical and functional properties of this phenomenon. The study further conducted a content-centric synthesis of the literature and identified the sustainable development functions of Industry 5.0. Next, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique was employed to identify the sequential relationships among the functions and construct the Industry 5.0-enabled model of sustainable development. The ISM involved collecting the opinions of 11 Industry 5.0 experts through expert panel meetings. Results revealed that Industry 5.0 delivers sustainable development values through 16 functions. Circular intelligent products, employee technical assistance, intelligent automation, open sustainable innovation, renewable integration, and supply chain adaptability are examples of the functions identified. These functions are highly interrelated and should be developed in a specific order so that the synergies and complementarities among them would maximize the sustainable development value gains. The roadmap to Industry 5.0-driven sustainability developed in this study is expected to provide a better understanding of ways Industry 5.0 can contribute to sustainable development, explaining how the development of its functions should be managed to maximize their synergies and contribution to the intended sustainability values. The study also highlights important avenues for future research, emphasizing the potential enablers of Industry 5.0 development, such as Government 5.0 or Corporate Governance 5.0.}

This undoubtedly will make 6G more flexible, agile, autonomous, intelligent, and cost-efficient networks. However, the programmability and openness will make 6G networks more prone to issues like security, privacy, traceability, interoperability, auditability, resource manageability, spectrum efficiency, and 3D mobility. To address these issues, a deep integration of blockchain technology with 6G networks is foreseen. Thus, we aim to put together blockchain and 6G under a magnifying lens to gain a comprehensive understanding of the role of blockchain in the 6G ecosystem. We begin by providing an overview of the envisioned 6G networks and blockchain technology. Next, we present a high-level view of the role of blockchain for 6G trends and requirements. Following that, we conduct an in-depth study on how the blockchain can provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized underpinning to various technical aspects and use cases of 6G. Thereafter, we discuss the deployment challenges to be faced while integrating blockchain in 6G and the possible solutions.

However, the data sensed from various devices is privacy-sensitive and not always trustworthy so that the cloud server needs to extract truthful values while protecting the privacy of user personal data. Although some privacy-preserving truth discovery mechanisms have been proposed to address these issues, they ignore the fact that the reliability of truth discovery algorithms may be considerably degraded by outliers in sensing data, and still cannot guarantee strong privacy. In this article, we propose a Reliability-enhanced Privacy-preserving Truth Discovery scheme (RPTD) for MCS to overcome these shortcomings. First, we design a multi-client inner product functional encryption to fully protect the privacy of sensing data, user weights and inferred truths, while supporting dynamic users. Then a new filtering method is constructed to accurately identify outliers in encrypted sensing data submitted by users, which eliminates the disturbance of outliers on the reliability of truth discovery. Theoretical analysis shows that RPTD ensures practical efficiency in computing and communication overhead while ensuring strong privacy and outliers filtering. Experimental results validate feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed RPTD scheme.}

Drawing on a systematic review of ninety-six publications across the digital taxation, taxation, and information systems (IS) literature, a comprehensive conceptual framework is developed to improve our success of digital services in tax administration. The conceptual framework identifies fifteen themes for consideration by policymakers when designing digital services in tax administrations clustered around four categories – Context, Stakeholders, Technology and Demonstrated Results. The framework should also serve as a reference point in successfully developing strategies and measures to embed digital services in tax administrations. Future research directions are also proposed based on the conceptual framework that will help advance our understanding of digital services in tax administration beyond technology acceptance models.}

In this work, we explore how the domains of smart cities, smart transport, and smart energy will evolve until 2030 from a scientific and technological perspective, as a means to inform future policies for urban development in Europe. We started our work with an extensive review of recent and relevant research, covering policy and market reports, scientific journal articles, and other scientific publications. Then, a two-round Delphi survey with 120 field experts was conducted to assess the plausibility of the literature review findings to materialize until 2030. According to our empirical findings, there will be several speedy and structural changes in the three domains: we were able to identify a set of 18 statements that are highly probable to become reality in the next decade, whereas 17 statements were classified as plausible but not highly probable, and three statements raised controversiality. This work provides significant added value in supporting territorial policymakers' and stakeholders' decision making under uncertainty, as well as in designing highly relevant research agendas, attuned to contemporary and emerging trends.}

In these cities, IoT technology generates vast amounts of data at any given time, which is analyzed to provide services to citizens. In the proper implementation of these cities, a critical challenge is the violation of citizens' privacy and security, which leads to a lack of trust and pessimism toward the services of the smart city. To ensure citizens' participation, smart city developers should adequately protect their security and privacy from gaining their trust. If citizens don't want to participate, the main benefits of a smart city will be lost. This article presents a comprehensive review of smart city security issues and privacy. It provides a basis for categorizing current and future developments in this area and developing a thematic classification to highlight the requirements and security strategies for designing a smart and safe city.

Innovation ecosystems are experiencing this platformization, leading to the rise of platform-based innovation ecosystems. However, the industrial and managerial literature still lacks a shared definition, a consistent theoretical and strategic framework to explain how platform-based innovation ecosystems emerge and replicate from market to market. This conceptual work attempts to fill those gaps by integrating the extant literature on innovation ecosystems in two ways. First, moving from the literature on innovation ecosystems and industry platforms, using systems thinking framing, it explains the platformization of innovation ecosystems through the double lens structure-system. Second, it identifies the holographic strategy as one of the typical patterns featuring platform-based innovation ecosystem envelopment beyond extant market boundaries. These conceptualizations have insightful theoretical, managerial, and policy implications. In particular, the work discusses the ecosystem as a valid unit of analysis for understanding such an unprecedented shaped-by-platform landscape. Then, it describes the growth strategies of the platform-based innovation ecosystem supporting the platform sponsor in mastering multipoint competition. Eventually, the study pinpoints crucial issues for policymakers in regulating the impact that platformization is having on society.}

The project started by considering both countries' national strategies for Industry 4.0 (MAKE-in India and Made Smarter, UK) to identify those areas marked as strategically critical and mapping them onto existing engineering curriculums across undergraduate engineering degrees. Based on local industry partners with clearly defined ‘digitalization’ opportunities, four industrial case studies were selected and reproduced inside both University labs in the form of student projects that were made available to all final year mechanical engineering students at both institutions. The resulting pilot projects exhibited the potential to expose undergraduate students to engineering concepts and techniques not currently covered in the taught curriculums, while offering industry a ‘soft landing’ on the use of Industry 4.0 tools which have not yet been embraced, mainly due to the lack of qualified personnel or access to specific technology skillsets, such as 3D printing, Augmented Reality and Digital Twins.}

Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to redefine the principles that should govern Sustainable Production operations in the transition towards a Circular Economy and smart industry models. To this end, an initial proposal of 11 principles was shared with 11 world-class experts (academics and practitioners) and a consensus proposal was sought through a Delphi Panel. Ten principles emerged from this study, which were evaluated by experts according to criteria of significance, parsimony, semantic consistency and empirical adequacy. Additionally, to study the relationships between the ten principles, the Interpretative Structural Model (ISM) technique was applied. The ISM technique identified which principles are independent of or dependent on each other and established relationships between the principles. The findings suggest that Principle 5 (“Prioritize employees' well-being”), Principle 6 (“Enhance management commitment to sustainability”), Principle 9 (“Measure and optimize sustainable processes”) and Principle 10 (“Boost the use of sustainable technologies”) help to establish an ideal context to enhance the development of the rest of the principles that characterize Sustainable Production. The presentation of the ten principles opens new possibilities for researchers while helping managers to better understand sustainability in terms of production and, therefore contribute to achieving SDG 12.}

These devices hold significant potential to impact the relation between cardiologists and their patients, but concerns exist about device trustworthiness to detect pertinent data points and deliver alerts with accuracy. How these devices’ features will interplay with cardiologists’ workflow has also yet to be defined and requires thoughtful implementation. Furthermore, the success of smartwatches as medical devices is dependent on patients’ continuous use.

In recent years, smart and ecological urbanism and transformations into the new models of city making have become a global mainstream. These are models of the smart city, the eco-city, and the eco-megacity. The article proposes a conceptual approach to the formation of the eco-megacity as a qualitatively new phenomenon in the post-industrial economy. The prerequisites for the transformation of a megapolis into an eco-megacity have been analyzed. The key characteristics of the new phenomenon have been revealed. The role of collaboration as the main factor in increasing the efficiency of interaction processes between ecosystem actors and between ecosystems themselves has been presented. The relationship of the formed ecosystem approaches and the groups of actors during implementation of an institutional project in the megapolis have been determined. It allows for the transformation of a megapolis into an eco-megacity. The ant colony optimization algorithm for studying the symbiosis of socio-economic ecosystems in the megapolis has been proposed. The authors have attempted to contribute to the development of theoretical and methodological aspects of the emerging eco-megacity concept as a new phenomenon of the modern economy.}

The global pandemic was caused by factors outside the banking sector and capital markets, therefore, the policy responses from this unique crisis provides us with new knowledge. Bank and FinTech stock prices were more sensitive to the government's macroeconomic announcements and the unwinding of containment measures than to monetary policy interventions in this unique environment. The response of banks and FinTechs to COVID-19 related macroeconomic decisions is consistent with the response of bank stock prices in previous financial crises. This finding suggests a stronger emphasis on macroeconomic announcements is required as a stabilizing policy tool when managing future crises from outside the banking and capital market sectors.}

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has disseminated guidelines for passenger ships to enhance the evacuation process understanding. Although the number of passenger ships is rising worldwide, implementing IMO's guidelines, particularly advance evacuation analysis, is still a young research area. Hence, this paper attempts to study previous research on human evacuation from the IMO perspective to uncover the current position of the issued guidelines in the literature. Accordingly, this research reviews 115 research publications published in scientific journals, peer-reviewed conferences, and doctoral and master dissertations from January 1999 to August 2022. As a result, the authors present the literature review of state-of-the-art papers to establish a firm foundation of past research. After identifying gaps, breakthrough points are clarified for future research about the benefits of handling uncertainty in input parameters, understanding human evacuation behavior, mutual interrelation among evacuation factors, and potential adoption of digital technologies in human evacuation from passenger ships.}

Due to its importance, scholars called for studies to expand our knowledge in this critical area. This paper identifies, extracts, and assesses the most critical factors that influence the implementation of AI systems. This study identifies nineteen factors and categorizes them into four categories: organization, technology, process, and environment. The analytical hierarchy process is used to evaluate the factors and the categories. The analysis offers two types of results, at the category level and the level of the factors. The results indicate that technology is the most significant of the four categories. The results also suggest that ethics is the most crucial factor among all nineteen factors.

Building on the industry lifecycle theory, we argue that electrification conveys many opportunities for upgrading, since it requires such a proliferation of innovative tasks that, coupled with a tight deadline imposed by the European regulatory framework, can be accomplished only through further decentralisation of R&D activities. Based on twenty expert interviews in Hungary and a review of global automotive actors' electrification-related transactions in central Europe, we find that the manufacturing-led growth model is not jeopardized by the transition to electrification, at least not in the medium run. Data suggests, however, that chances to harness the opportunities of electrification for meaningful industrial upgrading are low. Results predict continuity rather than radical change.}

However, businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in rural areas are often digitally disconnected due to inferior digital connectivity and digital exclusion, including lack of internet access and lower levels of digital literacy. Therefore, this paper provides a better understanding of the rural digital economy, highlighting key digital challenges and opportunities for rural businesses in the UK. An extensive review of both academic and non-academic literature is conducted to identify key digital challenges, digital opportunities, and solutions to overcome the digital disadvantage for rural businesses in the UK in the digital age. Our review emphasises the effectiveness of public sector market interventions in developing broadband infrastructure and smarter digital training and skills development to help address digital deprivation in rural areas. A series of policy recommendations is then formulated to support rural business growth in the digital age and contributing to debates regarding smart rural development in rural areas. This paper has potential limitations due to a non-systematic literature review.

We contribute to research on autonomous solutions by identifying four types of AVSs: (i) advanced-data-assisted solutions, (ii) semiautonomous platooning solutions, (iii) autonomous demarcated solutions, and (iv) autonomous swarmed solutions. We advance digital servitization and business model research by revealing business models associated with those AVSs, namely: (i) safety as a service, (ii) efficiency as a service, (iii) capacity as a service, and (iv) flexibility as a service. By combining these three fields of research, we enrich the digital servitization research and address the current gap in research on autonomous solutions by focusing on business models. Our analysis enables the development of novel conceptual tools for autonomous solutions and servitization driven by digitalization. Moreover, we suggest the concept of business model fluidity to explain rapid and autonomous business model changes and adaptation to different use contexts and customer contexts.}

abstract = {Agribusinesses need to answer to societal growing concerns regarding the use of natural resources. In this context, the digital technologies described by Industry 4.0 appear as allies in the optimization of agribusiness. The use of these technologies is closely related to digital transformation, leading to this work's goal: to analyze the dimensions of Digital Transformation (DT) in the Modern Agricultural (MA) context. The methodology of this study was divided into three main parts. Firstly, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was performed with the help of the SciMAT® software. Then, a content analysis was performed using a semantic technique to define the dimensions a posteriori. Finally, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model using the RStudio® software was made to validate the results found in the semantic analysis. To the best of our knowledge, there are only five studies that define dimensions of DT in MA, however none of them used a robust SLR with content analysis. Two of these studies did empirical researches with specialists to define the dimensions, and the other three defined specifics dimensions only a priori. Our study brings as an innovation the definition of the dimensions a posteriori through the SLR. Additionally, no studies that validated the results using a LDA model were found. As a result of our studies, we have identified eight dimensions: Economical, Government, Sustainability; Infrastructure, Technological, Cooperation, Change, and People/Knowledge/Skills. The first three dimensions are more influenced by external factors, while external and internal factors influence the following three, and finally, the last two are more affected by internal factors. For each set of the dimensions listed, the main pillars/drivers/motivators and the main barriers/challenges/difficulties were identified. For example, for the mixed dimension, the first set can be the creation of regional centers that broadcast digital technology content. Regarding the second set, we can cite the difficulty in transforming data into useful information for the same dimension. The results serve as a foundation for both practical business actions and the academic field. They presented a robust theoretical basis for developing guidelines for agricultural management (of farms and other related startups and companies) and public policies to encourage the adoption and implementation of technological resources guided by sustainable development goals. The impacts can be viewed as: reduced production through sustainable and responsible production, assistance in the conscious and sustainable use of water resources, and sustainable actions to mitigate climate change. In conclusion, we highlight that the environment in which the framework will be applied should influence the emphasis given to each set of dimensions. For instance, legislators that seek to develop policies for DT in MA should pay greater attention to the external dimensions. In contrast, farmers that seek to implement DT should be more focused on the internal dimensions.}

abstract = {The advancements in both hardware and software technologies have transformed the oil and gas a fully-automated and machine-dependent industry. Although this digital transformation improves the production efficiency, it can potentially create various forms of vulnerability and side-effects that can lead to disastrous events, such as toxic gas emission, fire hazards, and oil spills. In addition, the rapid change in the technologies creates doors to hack into the information technology (IT) platforms. Especially, the bridge between the IT and operational technology (OT) platform increases cyber-threats to the oil and gas operations. Hence, while developing smart technology for oil and gas, system engineers need to consider or beware of the downside of smart solutions. As such, the new and existing smart solutions should incorporate improved security techniques to enable the system's robustness. Moreover, the potential side-effects of smart solutions can hinder the production efficiency and become counter-productive. Accordingly, this chapter is dedicated to exploring the potential threats and side-effects of smart solutions and introducing possible solutions for these threats, so that we can have a robust and secure smart oil and gas industry.}

These futuristic scenarios will be unlocked by 5G connectivity, the next step after 4G, because it enables high data transfer volumes and low latency which can lead to many beneficial outcomes for technology applications in agri-food, such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain. Considerable progress is seen in the 5G ecosystem around the world, from South Korea to Australia and Europe. This review presents the opportunities and challenges of 5G in agri-food. The six most compelling use cases of 5G in agri-food at this moment from different parts of the world are in Brazil, the Netherlands, South Korea and the United Kingdom. The future of 5G in agri-food will depend on a number of enabling factors including interoperability, data governance and security, new business models, policy changes, and innovative ecosystems. The baseline scenario of connectivity and infrastructure for a region or country is determined by the dimensions of 5G aggregation-, cyber physical management- and decision-making levels, which guide future 5G applications in agri-food. Agriculture technology collaboration across the private and public sector and ecosystem development are the first steps for all countries to make progress towards large scale uptake of 5G in agri-food.}

Industry 4.0 readiness models are worthy methods to aid manufacturing organizations in tracking the development of their businesses and operations. Nevertheless, there are different Industry 4.0 readiness models; no work has yet analyzed Industry 4.0 readiness degree and causal effects relationships using fuzzy cognitive maps. This paper proposes an Industry 4.0 readiness model that consists of readiness requirements obtained from the literature and validated through a mixed-method approach, including literature reviews and questionnaires. To validate the proposed Industry 4.0 readiness model, the exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis methods are used. Fuzzy Cognitive Map is utilized to assess readiness, identify relevant concepts to improve readiness degree, implement Industry 4.0, and analyze causal relationships among concepts and dimensions. Through this model and the FCM method, managers can recognize relevant concepts and predict complicated cause-effect relationships among concepts in two states of static and dynamic analyses to increase readiness degree. The paper concludes by emphasizing managerial implications for successful applications in practice as well as future research suggestions on developing the Industry 4.0 readiness model.}

abstract = {Smart healthcare strategies have been identified as a potential solution to address the growing challenges faced by the healthcare sector. The ability of smart healthcare strategies to improve efficiency, patient's outcomes and delivery of quality healthcare has motivated and committed governments and policy makers to invest in this innovation. However, uptake and usage of smart healthcare strategies has not been successful as anticipated, and this is due to a number of challenges faced by different stakeholders during the adoption of these strategies. The objective of this paper is to systematically check published literature to identify and compile a comprehensive list of challenges of adopting smart healthcare strategies. Knowledge of these potential challenges gives stakeholders awareness and better prospects of dealing with the challenges of adopting smart healthcare strategies. A systematic literature review was conducted. EBSCOhost, PubMed, Scopus and Science Direct were searched for full text, peer reviewed, English language articles that reported the challenges for successful adoption of smart healthcare management strategies. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were used to select eligible articles. After the full screening, 26 articles that met the criteria were analysed and reported. Three main themes of challenges that affect the adoption of smart healthcare strategies have been identified based on technology-organisation-environment (TOE) framework. The findings of this study demonstrate that different TOE challenges affect smart health strategies adoption by healthcare sector. This study, therefore, proposes a differentiated approach to policies and practices to effectively scale up adoption of smart health and reduce failure rates of smart health projects. It is concluded that future research is needed in identifying key change management strategies to successfully manage the identified challenges to improve the prospects of successful adoption of smart healthcare strategies.}

abstract = {While the recent discussion on Art. 25 GDPR often considers the approach of data protection by design as an innovative idea, the notion of making data protection law more effective through requiring the data controller to implement the legal norms into the processing design is almost as old as the data protection debate. However, there is another, more recent shift in establishing the data protection by design approach through law, which is not yet understood to its fullest extent in the debate. Art. 25 GDPR requires the controller to not only implement the legal norms into the processing design but to do so in an effective manner. By explicitly declaring the effectiveness of the protection measures to be the legally required result, the legislator inevitably raises the question of which methods can be used to test and assure such efficacy. In our opinion, extending the legal compatibility assessment to the real effects of the required measures opens this approach to interdisciplinary methodologies. In this paper, we first summarise the current state of research on the methodology established in Art. 25 sect. 1 GDPR, and pinpoint some of the challenges of incorporating interdisciplinary research methodologies. On this premise, we present an empirical research methodology and first findings which offer one approach to answering the question on how to specify processing purposes effectively. Lastly, we discuss the implications of these findings for the legal interpretation of Art. 25 GDPR and related provisions, especially with respect to a more effective implementation of transparency and consent, and provide an outlook on possible next research steps.}

abstract = {Big Data is the collection of data that is non-rivalrous in consumption. Since Big Data is not physically tangible like movable or immovable property and is not subject to restrictive clauses in property law such as the “idea-expression dichotomy” and “fair use and term of protection”, it is fundamentally inappropriate to regard Big Data as an object of real rights. The protection of Big Data requires a paradigm shift from a rights-based “empowerment” approach to that of “behavioural regulation”. Accordingly, the protection of Big Data should not be seen as pitting the approaches of “empowerment” against “behavioural regulation”; rather, it should be seen as achieving coordination between behavioural regulation laws. To effectively balance the interests of data enterprises and the public, this article argues that a competition-based behavioural regulation regime that prohibits unfair competition between data enterprises is more desirable than an intellectual property “rights” regime that protects enterprises’ big data through exclusive rights.}

Taking into account all the benefits of AVs, the rapid development of AVs in all countries is becoming a very important factor. This research considers the assessment of the households welfare influence on the development of AVs. To ensure realistic future scenarios modelling was supported by empirical data. The obtained modelling results made it possible to predict a significant reduction in traffic accidents and environmental pollution, and to consider some policy recommendations to promote the development and a broader range introduction of AVs. The method of agent-based modelling was used to develop the market penetration simulation, which allowed quantifying consumer motives and opportunities in choosing AVs, the development trends of AVs, and providing policy recommendations not only for aggregated country level situations, but for households and individuals as well. The proposed model and results may be useful for planners and researchers working on long-term solutions related to safer and less polluting AVs and predicting purchasing behaviour of households.}

The latter has significantly grown during the last two decades, with further amplifications during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has created operational and policy making challenges for firms when deciding about how best to manage the resulting growth in e-commerce. While the impact of e-commerce on supply chains has been widely recognized in the literature, there was no effort to systematically review the literature, conceptualize some of the challenges and propose future research directions. This paper fills this gap by reviewing 153 publications from 1999 to 2019. We classify the reviewed literature based on which supply chain drivers were investigated, as well as, the employed research methodology. In addition, we conduct network and content analysis to uncover the main research themes and potential research directions namely, developing analytical centred; modelling based ecosystem for environment; leveraging data mining to enhance sustainability; balance between growth and sustainability; consumer demand and uncertainty; coordination in e-commerce logistics; last mile alternatives and cost management of innovative technique implementations. Furthermore, based on our literature review, we propose a conceptual framework where we interlink supply chain stages with a firm’s business strategy, digital transformation strategy and performance.}

Besides, the AmI-IoT has improved patient engagement and gratification as doctors’ interactions have become more comfortable and efficient. However, the benefits of the AmI-IoT-based healthcare applications are not availed entirely due to the adversarial threats. IoT networks are prone to cyber attacks due to vulnerable wireless mediums and the absentia of lightweight and robust security protocols. This paper introduces computationally-inexpensive privacy-assuring authentication protocol for AmI-IoT healthcare applications. The use of blockchain & fog computing in the protocol guarantees unforgeability, non-repudiation, transparency, low latency, and efficient bandwidth utilization. The protocol uses physically unclonable functions (PUF), biometrics, and Ethereum powered smart contracts to prevent replay, impersonation, and cloning attacks. Results prove the resource efficiency of the protocol as the smart contract incurs very minimal gas and transaction fees. The Scyther results validate the robustness of the proposed protocol against cyber-attacks. The protocol applies lightweight cryptography primitives (Hash, PUF) instead of conventional public-key cryptography and scalar multiplications. Consequently, the proposed protocol is better than centralized infrastructure-based authentication approaches.}

A collaborative detection system is initially used to detect the DDoS on IoT devices using the machine learning-based ensemble technique, which provides a lower false-positive rate and better detection rate than the other classification technique.

Smart buildings (SB) use resources efficiently, save energy, and provide services to the community more easily for their occupants while reducing their environmental footprint. Smart cities have benefited from this growth in terms of smart buildings. Maximum accuracy and reduced latency are both required for smart building monitoring systems. Poor scheduling rules can lead to network congestion and latency that is too high for real-time monitoring on construction sites, which have restricted computing and networking capabilities. These devices can collect the data on on-site actions, achievements, and circumstances and send it back to the central dashboard for analysis. Model predictive control and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have significant drawbacks, and DRL addresses some drawbacks. Researchers are intrigued by DRL, a brand-new approach to quality control. The most important considerations for developing smart power grid systems are energy conservation, renewable energy integration, and a streamlined control system. Experiments have shown that the new video surveillance has a low loss rate and a consistent latency. The DRL-SB-IoT technique can successfully track multiple cameras in a wide monitoring situation. This technique results in excellent tracking performance and meets the criteria for developing an intelligent campus in the best way possible. Researchers analyzed studies using supervised learning to solve common building issues, such as health monitoring, security on building sites, accommodation modeling, and energy consumption prediction. Reinforcement learning has been used to solve these issues. The proposed method advances the smart gateway channel of 97.5%, the energy storage ratio of 96.9%, and the overall surveillance performance ratio of 98.6%.}

Our research, using a grounded theory approach, identifies four key activities (and 37 sub-activities or themes) stemming from the new managerial needs and talent management practices arising from DT processes. We branded these key activities “Drive business change”, “Master fluid & loose organizational structures”, “Master Talent Complexity”, and “Prioritize learning”. This paper aims to provide an overview into the thinking and managerial practices of senior executives in a digital transformation context and complements the limited number of studies that examine the intersection between managerial actions and digital transformation. It also provides a conceptual framework that captures the key managerial demands arising from digital transformation processes and identifies key actions made by senior executives as part of these processes, which can be leveraged by both scholars and practitioners alike.}

abstract = {The transformations generated by Industry 4.0 (I4.0) are interwoven with digitalization. I4.0 involves the digital turn of manufacturing companies, changing the way they operate, their business models, and by extension, their interaction with digital players. Nonetheless, the future of I4.0 regarding its interaction with digital players and the phenomenon of uberization has scarcely been examined. Thus, this research adopts a participatory and systemic foresight approach to explore the trajectories of I4.0 in the face of uberization. The study was conducted with a working group of 22 members from academia and practice. Four scenarios and related action plans were produced. The results emphasize that uberization is not necessarily a process to be endured by manufacturers, but it could be chosen or even co-constructed with different actors if manufacturers address key challenges such as rethinking their business models and adapting their factors of production. The scenarios indicate the dynamics of uberization as contingent on technological developments and on industrial policy choices, changes in consumer behavior, and access to multiple funding sources. Finally, the study provides practical implications regarding the dynamics of collaboration between SMEs and large groups, on one hand, and between manufacturing companies and digital players, on the other hand.}

abstract = {Background
Leading influencing factors for telemedicine implementation remain unclear, affecting the focus of intervention strategies. Despite recent effectiveness evidence of video telemedicine visits, limited evidence exists regarding patients’ willingness to use video follow-up. Moreover, patients’ acceptance is crucial for implementing such services.
Objective
We conducted a large-sample survey to analyze patient willingness and perceptions of post-discharge video follow-up and assessed the factors influencing their willingness during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Method
In February and March 2022, we conducted a face-to-face questionnaire survey involving inpatients in a tertiary care hospital in Longhua District, Shenzhen, China. We assessed demographics, health-related determinants, access to technology and literacy, preferences, willingness, and opinions toward video telemedicine follow-up. We implemented random forest and logistic regression analyses to obtain reliable results.
Results
In total, 1,017 inpatients completed the survey. Overall, as an initial choice, 44.9 % preferred telephone consultation for post-discharge follow-up, which was followed by video telemedicine (17.1 %), WeChat voice calls (11.6 %), SMS text messages (10.7 %), WeChat graphic messages (10.5 %), and in-person visits (4.5 %). Moreover, 54.9 % were willing to experience video visits. The results highlight the perceived benefits outweighing the risks (OR 2.64, 95 % CI 1.76, 3.95), patients’ trust in the physician (OR 2.41, 95 % CI 1.45, 3.99), access to a private space (OR 2.18, 95 % CI 1.01, 2.96), medium geographical distance (compared to long distance, OR 0.72, 95 % CI 0.54, 0.98), moderate disease (compared to mild disease, OR 0.75, 95 % CI 0.57, 0.99), followed by the comfort with video technology (OR 1.73, 95 % CI 1.76, 3.95), broadband internet accessibility (OR 1.56, 95 % CI 1.07, 2.27), privacy concerns (OR 0.62, 95 % CI 0.43, 0.89), and prior telemedicine video experience (OR 1.77, 95 % CI 1.15, 2.72), as factors influencing the willingness to use video follow-up.
Conclusions
A low percentage of patients chose video visits as their initial decisions; nevertheless, most had a positive attitude toward video follow-up visits. The willingness to choose video telemedicine post-discharge follow-up was influenced by geographical distance, disease severity, basic telemedicine requirements, physician–patient relationship, and perceptions of video communication.}

Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) has been receiving increasingly more attention all over the world as a special way for accessing new ideas and innovative opportunities through minor-share investing in established companies. The purpose of CVC investments may either be purely financial or to pursue strategic goals. Organisations often seek to take actions that impact positively on sustainability by assembling related knowledge and technologies. These resources may come from invested startups through the use of a CVC programme. This research aims to measure and analyse the Corporate Venture Capital programmes of companies listed in the ISE B3 Corporate Sustainability Index. To this end, a three-step methodology was conducted. First, a systematic review of the literature took place, followed by a review of companies based on secondary sources such as their websites. Finally, a survey was developed and was opted to survey companies through their Investor Relationship (IR) public channels. Results show that 27 of the companies listed in the ISE B3 Index have CVC programmes that contemplate organizational initiatives besides investment. In this sense, one can claim that at least 70% of the ISE B3 Index companies are somehow involved in CVC operations. The results contribute to the literature on corporate venture capital and sustainability by showing that companies spend from 10% to 15% of their capital in sustainable businesses in order to remain competitive.}

This study investigates the variables affecting the adoption of blockchain technology (BT) among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with the application of artificial intelligence (AI) via the mediating lens of risk-taking behavior. As an initial sample, 150 owners/top managers from 150 SMEs (one informant from each) in Dhaka, Bangladesh, were chosen. A stratified random sample was employed for this cross-sectional study. Applying structural equation modeling, the combined influence of internal and external variables influencing the intention to adopt BT is explored. Results show that: (1) knowledge of artificial intelligence has a positive and significant effect on the adoption of blockchain technology; (2) the relevant advantage of artificial intelligence has a positive and significant effect on the adoption of blockchain technology; (3) perceived ease of use of artificial intelligence has a positive and significant effect on the adoption of blockchain technology; (4) risk-taking behavior mediates the relationship between knowledge of artificial intelligence and adoption of blockchain technology; (5) risk-taking behavior does not mediate the relationship between relevant advantage and perceived ease of use of artificial intelligence with the adoption of blockchain technology. The current study is one of the few empirical investigations relating to SMEs using artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies for business operations. The study’s limitations are the small sample size and use of a single informant. However, the findings on the adoption of blockchain technology have applications for boosting the competitiveness of SMEs. This study’s originality stems from two factors: the novelty of blockchain technology and its potential to upend SMEs’ conventional mode of operation. It highlights the need to consider the key variables affecting SMEs’ adoption of blockchain technology with artificial intelligence.}

Hence, this paper comprehensively reviews the EI concept for utility energy service and demand-side management (DSM) in SG, related issues, and future directions. In line with the matter, this review showcases an inclusive description of EI technology, highlighting architecture, theory, and applications. Besides, the various EI integrated utility services are discussed with regard to cloud-based utility service, one-stop online utility service, short message service-based utility service, future utility service, and affordable utility service. Moreover, the DSM in SG connected with EI environment is explored, covering the resilience of EI architecture, 5G based EI, and EI-based DSM for sustainable consumption. The numerous key issues, problems, and challenges are outlined to identify the existing research gaps. Finally, the review proposes some improvements for future opportunities and developments for EI in utility energy service and DSM in SG. All the critical discussion, analysis, and suggestions would be valuable for the power engineer and researchers to enhance EI-based SG for future sustainable operation and management.}

AI, on the other hand, and its applications have been used for developing futuristic machines that are capable of having human-like intelligence. The use of both technologies in transportation systems has seen a tremendous growth that resulted in transformation of the transportation industry. Various modes of transportation, such as new transit systems, metro rails, high-speed rails, connected and automated vehicles, autonomous trains, and other emerging transportation modes (hyperloop, e-scooters, hoverboards), still face many challenges, including but not limited to economic issues, energy efficiency, social adoption, data privacy, lack of regulatory standards, reliability, security, and ethical issues. The use of blockchain and AI technologies has the potential to fill the technology gaps in transportation systems and effectively address the existing challenges. The convergence of both technologies is likely to yield significant advantages and provide a common distributed platform for data sharing, reliability, and decision-making. The present study is focused on understanding both technologies and their convergence in various industrial domains with a specific emphasis on transportation systems. A detailed state-of-the-art review of the relevant literature is performed to identify the main advantages and challenges in the applications of blockchain and AI in transportation systems and other related domains along with the ways to overcome these challenges.

However, the implementation of blockchain at the organizational levels can be related with several technical, organizational, legal, financial, and environmental challenges (intra-organizational and inter-organizational). Analysis of these challenges will play a significant role in organizational performance. This study has investigated an extensive list of challenges of software blockchain-based implementation in cyber-physical systems. The proposed comprehensive model is applied to the software development industry in Iran as a case study. Based on the experts’ opinions, challenge identification was conducted via the two-phase fuzzy Delphi method for medium and large organizations. Extensive quantitative and qualitative challenges are evaluated via the efficient best-worst fuzzy method. Obtained results indicate that smart contracts vulnerabilities and deterministic execution of the technical challenge group have the most critical importance and governance of the legal challenge group has the least vital importance. It is mentionable that most technical challenges have higher priority than other considered challenges.}

To what extent “traditional” profit-oriented motivations coexisted with other motivations (such as corporate social responsibility and marketing) remains largely under-investigated. Similarly, while many studies emphasized that inter-organizational collaborations enabled COVID-related innovation projects, how these collaborations intertwined with the motivations to innovate is unknown. This article fills the literature gaps by exploring the motivations underlying COVID-related innovations, the role of inter-organizational collaboration, and their relationship with innovation novelty. We studied 18 Italian COVID-19-related innovations developed during the initial pandemic phase. We considered two industrial motivations based on the exploration-exploitation dichotomy and two institutional motivations (corporate social responsibility and marketing). Using the crisp set Qualitative Comparative Analysis, we found that institutional motivations have driven most radical and incremental innovation projects. However, they were not sufficient conditions for them. We observed that radical innovations were supported by either transversal alliances, involving horizontal collaboration and R&D institutions, or by vertical alliances, where a supplier-customer collaboration aimed to explore new business opportunities while benefiting from the favorable contingent marketing effects. Incremental innovations often occurred without industrial motivations, supported by either vertical or horizontal collaboration.}

Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has shown itself capable of contributing to the development or reformulation of organizational processes to make them more competitive and sustainable. Thus, this article aims to propose drivers for the development of corporate sustainability via I4.0. To this end, a literature review and content analysis were used as research methods to identify and analyze, in recent scientific literature, boosting elements that enable organizational processes to become more sustainable via I4.0. Based on these elements, six drivers were systematized and proposed: strategy; product and process design; energy and material resources; people; smart production; and supply chain. Each driver was discussed in light of the scientific literature to generate recommendations for companies to develop the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. The main theoretical-scientific contribution of this work is the deepening and expansion of the knowledge block that articulates corporate sustainability with I4.0, which strengthens the basis for the development of new research on these topics and creates a reference for the analysis and discussion of empirical studies. As an applied-managerial contribution, the drivers proposed in this work will provide organizations and their managers with a point of reference to effectively move towards sustainability, making their businesses greener, fairer, and more profitable. A limitation of this study is that the proposed drivers were based on the 30 most cited articles and did not consider other sources, such as documentation from companies. Therefore, for future studies, we suggest increasing the article base and include organizational repositories and identify how SMEs can become sustainable through I4.0 in a way that strengthens the social dimension of sustainability.}

Past research has shown that Time-of-Use Tariffs (TOUT) is a powerful tool to reduce water consumption in urban settings. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of this dynamic water pricing approach might be influenced by the socioeconomic conditions and preferences of households. To shed light on this issue, this paper employed an agent-based modelling method to simulate the possible socioeconomic effects of implementing TOUT in a Spanish municipality. The types of households were characterized according to size, number of inhabitants, income and to socio-cognitive profiles (clients, techno-solutionist, committed and environmentalist). Results from the modelling indicate that the implementation of a TOUT system would reduce domestic water use by 17.2%. However, this reduction was not homogenous for the socioeconomic groups of households defined. Low-income households are those who most reduced their water consumption (25.0%) but had the lowest water bill savings (9.3%). By contrast, high-income households present the largest water bill savings (11.9%) but the lowest reduction in water use (10.4%). The findings of this study evidence the importance of considering the socioeconomic and socio-cognitive differences among water users to evaluate the effectiveness of TOUTs.}

Supply chains are dominant concerns for many organisations, governments, policy makers, and consumers. A primary requirement in addressing many contemporary supply chain challenges is the need to ‘map’ a supply system. With notable exceptions, much of the supply chain management literature has shied away from providing guidance on the mapping process. In this paper, we stress the reasons for the increased emphasis on mapping. We review the academic literature, highlighting the diversity of mapping exercises conducted by researchers and the lack of clarity about the different types of maps developed. Supply chain mapping has been used as an umbrella term for studies at very different aggregation levels. We define the fundamental elements needed to create a supply chain map and develop a formal hierarchy of supply systems for mapping at different levels of analysis. The hierarchy provides a structured way to consider the diversity of mapping exercises in the literature and to define the unit of analysis for a mapping study. We illustrate the hierarchy with a range of examples from the textile and apparel industry. We identify the primary and secondary data sources that can underpin mapping studies, highlighting the significant challenges in using them. We discuss the emerging commercial solutions to capture, map, and analyse supply systems for different purposes. In an increasingly data rich world, there are many opportunities to develop the supply chain mapping process further.}

Virtual environments and immersive games (such as, Second Life, Fortnite, Roblox and VRChat) have been described as antecedents of the metaverse and offer some insight to the potential socio-economic impact of a fully functional persistent cross platform metaverse. Separating the hype and “meta…” rebranding from current reality is difficult, as “big tech” paints a picture of the transformative nature of the metaverse and how it will positively impact people in their work, leisure, and social interaction. The potential impact on the way we conduct business, interact with brands and others, and develop shared experiences is likely to be transformational as the distinct lines between physical and digital are likely to be somewhat blurred from current perceptions. However, although the technology and infrastructure does not yet exist to allow the development of new immersive virtual worlds at scale - one that our avatars could transcend across platforms, researchers are increasingly examining the transformative impact of the metaverse. Impacted sectors include marketing, education, healthcare as well as societal effects relating to social interaction factors from widespread adoption, and issues relating to trust, privacy, bias, disinformation, application of law as well as psychological aspects linked to addiction and impact on vulnerable people. This study examines these topics in detail by combining the informed narrative and multi-perspective approach from experts with varied disciplinary backgrounds on many aspects of the metaverse and its transformational impact.

Through the use of multi-sensor systems and Decision Support Systems, it is possible to collect, analyze, and process huge amounts of data on agriculture. This supports the farmer in the decision-making process to optimize the results in terms of quality and quantity, to avoid waste, and to maximize profits. However, the use of IoT and intelligent communication technologies can introduce a number of intentional and unintentional weaknesses and flaws in data and information management. The research proposes an Anomaly Detection System (a multi-layered architecture) to mitigate the infrastructure threats in a pro-active way in the Smart Agriculture domain. The design of the proposed architecture is based on a machine-learning algorithmic approach by a multivariate linear regression (MLR) and a long-term memory neural network algorithm (LSTM). The application of the Anomaly Detection System was done on a real dataset coming from a smart agriculture system located in the Apulia region (Italy).}

Since these channels are data-intensive dependent, they usually require data sources from the company's service ecosystem. Prior studies have shown how to build network capabilities for Smart PSS, but little is known about the extensive integration of data in such service ecosystems. We aim to understand how multichannel digital services can be supported by the integration of real-time data from service ecosystems to provide Smart PSS business models. Using the organizational information-processing theory, we consider the integration of data from three ecosystem actors (other business units, suppliers, and customers) and analyze how such data sources can support the use of these digital technologies in three types of Smart PSS business models. We examine these relationships through regression analyses based on a survey of 92 manufacturers, providing a typology of different Smart PSS business models in the ecosystem. Our study enlightens how data flows through the ecosystem actors to support Smart PSS business models. Practitioners and scholars can learn how to treat Smart PSS according to the specific business models to be implemented and how to combine digital technologies with data integration channels in the service ecosystem. Moreover, we show how this combination of digital transformation and Smart PSS help expand the organizational information-processing theory in the innovation ecosystems' domain, also providing a new vein of research to the digital servitization literature.}

Therefore, both are anticipated to experience exponential growth in the upcoming years. Healthcare firms have many opportunities to employ IoB to provide individualised services and anticipate patients’ behaviour. As behaviour and analysis are closely related to psychology, many techniques exist to collect relevant data. The IoB improves the doctor’s and patient’s experience. As IoT and IoB are interconnected, IoB technology collects and analyses data depending on user activity. These offer a practical technique for developing real-time remote health monitoring systems. This technology aids in the optimisation of auto insurance premiums in the healthcare sector. It tries to alter patient behaviour in order to improve the treatment process. IoB has applications in various areas, including retail and entertainment, and has the potential to change the marketing sector significantly. This technology is helpful for the appropriate analysis and comprehension of behavioural data used for creating valuable services for treatment. The primary purpose of this paper is to study IoB and its need for healthcare. The working process structure and features of IoB for the healthcare domain are studied. This paper further identifies and analyses the significant applications of IoB for healthcare. In the future, IoB technologies will give us a higher quality of life and well-being. IoB is the ideal fusion of technology, data analytics, and behavioural science. This will help healthcare professionals collect data and analyse the patient’s behaviours for an efficient treatment process. The IoB will be the digital ecosystem’s intelligence in a few years.}

abstract = {Network slicing is a core technique of fifth-generation (5G) systems and beyond. To maximize the number of accepted network slices with limited hardware resources, service providers must avoid over-provisioning of quality-of-service (QoS), which could prevent them from lowering capital expenditures (CAPEX)/operating expenses (OPEX) for 5G infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a sub-action aided double deep Q-network (SADDQN)-based network slicing algorithm for latency-aware services. Specifically, we model network slicing as a Markov decision process (MDP), where we consider virtual network function (VNF) placements to be the actions of the MDP, and define a reward function based on cost and service priority. Furthermore, we adopt the Dijkstra algorithm to determine the forwarding graph (FG) embedding for a given VNF placement and design a resource allocation algorithm – binary search assisted gradient descent (BSAGD) – to allocate resources to VNFs given the VNF-FG placement. For every service request, we first use the DDQN to choose an MDP action to determine the VNF placement (main action). Next, we employ the Dijkstra algorithm (first-phase sub-action) to find the shortest path for each pair of adjacent VNFs in the given VNF chain. Finally, we implement the BSAGD (second-phase sub-action) to realize this service with the minimum cost. The joint action results in an MDP reward that can be utilized to train the DDQN. Numerical evaluations show that, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm can improve the cost-efficiency while giving priority to higher-priority services and maximizing the acceptance ratio.}

Data breaches in financial institutions could produce extensive damage to an organization's operations. Therefore, it is critical for organizations to identify and assess threats in their operational environment to be able to implement prevention and mitigation strategies. Applying Routine Activity Theory (RAT), this paper develops a risk assessment model using employees’ perceptions of risks relative to potential breaches of sensitive data in their organizations. This paper empirically examines the roles of motivated offenders, suitable targets, and the influences of capable guardianship within the organization. Analyses of surveyed employees show that perceptions of value (using a multi-dimensional perspective), inertia, and accessibility of targeted sensitive data along with presence of guardians have an impact on assessment of risk about data breaches in financial institutions. The paper also extends RAT to account for the amount of information (both online and offline) available regarding the data influence the relationship between value of the sensitive data and suitability for data breach. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.}

First, relative to the traditional Global North sources, China has become a major source of ICT in SSA. Second, over the past two decades, Chinese firms operating in SSA have adopted a Schumpeterian character to gain legitimacy in the communities in which they operate. Third, with the easier transfer of ICT from China, local ICT firms in SSA have upgraded their value chains from only delivering information services to becoming important players in the financial sector, including the provision of mobile money transfer services. We conclude that China's expansive size, coupled with its ability to produce technologies for low-income economies, is likely to ensure that it will remain the dominant source of ICT innovations for SSA.}

This study analyzes the demand for digital forest recreation in the metaverse by conducting a discrete choice experiment with university students as potential metaverse users to fill this knowledge gap. The study results revealed that users preferred digital forest recreation to experience outdoor adventure and a nature-based digital twin in the metaverse, indicating that digital forest recreation has the potential to influence human-nature interactions. The students required responsible and immersive metaverse platforms for digital forest recreation that were not subject to invasions of user privacy (e.g., selling big data of users), biased algorithms (e.g., racism), algorithms selling virtual goods, cyberaggression (e.g., trolling), and less immersive virtual experiences. These findings highlight both opportunities and challenges for creating user-centered digital forest recreation in the metaverse.

However, most of these algorithms modified the global or local region of pixels without taking network explanations into account. Hence, the perturbations are redundant, which are easily detected by human eyes. In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate local region perturbations. The main idea is to find a contributing feature region (CFR) of an image by simulating the human attention mechanism and then add perturbations to CFR. Furthermore, a soft mask matrix is designed on the basis of an activation map to finely represent the contributions of each pixel in CFR. With this soft mask, we develop a new loss function with inverse temperature to search for optimal perturbations in CFR. Due to the network explanations, the perturbations added to CFR are more effective than those added to other regions. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 and ILSVRC2012 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, including attack success rate, imperceptibility, and transferability.}

A key advance has been achieving consensus on the clinical definition of various forms of PUI. Based on the overarching public health principles of protecting individuals and the public from harm and promoting the highest attainable standard of health, the World Health Organisation has introduced several new structured diagnoses into the ICD-11, including gambling disorder, gaming disorder, compulsive sexual behaviour disorder, and other unspecified or specified disorders due to addictive behaviours, alongside naming online activity as a diagnostic specifier. These definitions provide for the first time a sound platform for developing systematic networked research into various forms of PUI at global scale. Progress has also been made in areas such as refining and simplifying some of the available assessment instruments, clarifying the underpinning brain-based and social determinants, and building more empirically based etiological models, as a basis for therapeutic intervention, alongside public engagement initiatives. However, important gaps in our knowledge remain to be tackled. Principal among these include a better understanding of the course and evolution of the PUI-related problems, across different age groups, genders and other specific vulnerable groups, reliable methods for early identification of individuals at risk (before PUI becomes disordered), efficacious preventative and therapeutic interventions and ethical health and social policy changes that adequately safeguard human digital rights. The paper concludes with recommendations for achievable research goals, based on longitudinal analysis of a large multinational cohort co-designed with public stakeholders.}

At first, the threats to a process system are identified, followed by analyzing the factors that may lead to these threats. Then the mechanisms to neutralize threats using safeguards are discussed. These steps are modelled in a Bayesian network (BN) framework to capture the probabilistic nature of the events and associated factors. The BN model is used to analyze the real-time risk. The proposed framework is used to study four scenarios. A comparison with previous works confirms that the proposed framework provides better understanding and analysis capabilities. This work will serve as a reference point for further development in integrated safety and security analysis.}

This article reviews the literature and patents in four closely related fields and aims to provide a holistic view of how they are related and their integrability in relation to smart energy management strategies. Artificial intelligence models forecast energy use and load profiles as well as schedule resources to ensure reliable performance and effective utilization of energy resources. Training artificial intelligence models requires immense volumes of data. Utilizing big data systems and data mining enables the discovery of new functions and relationships, which determines the performance of artificial intelligence. Data mining also refines the information; thus, artificial intelligence is trained iteratively with more accurate data. Smart energy management can be further enhanced through advanced digital technologies like Internet of Things and blockchain. An Internet of Things platform containing edge, fog and cloud layers helps connect artificial intelligence to other hardware and software devices and systems. Furthermore, an Internet of Things platform efficiently transmits and stores data, improving access and availability to stakeholders for data mining. Emerging technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrency facilitate energy trading and can be designed in the cloud layer of an Internet of Things platform to supplement data storage. Providing an efficient and seamless integration of artificial intelligence, big data, and advanced digital technologies will be an important factor in the emerging transition of the energy sector to a lower-carbon system.}

Contact tracing applications are technological solutions that can quickly trace and notify users of their potential exposure to the Covid-19 virus and help contain the spread of the disease. However, extant research delineating the various factors predicting the adoption of contact tracing apps is scant. The study's primary objective is to develop and validate a research model based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), health belief model (HBM), perceived privacy risk and perceived security risk to understand the adoption of contact tracing application.
Methods
An online survey was carried out among users of the ‘Aarogya Setu’ contact tracing app in India. The partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) tool was employed to analyze data from 307 respondents.
Results
The results showed that performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions positively influenced users’ intention to adopt the app. In contrast, perceived privacy and security risks were significant barriers to app adoption. Perceived disease threat as a moderator mitigated the adverse impact of perceived privacy risk on users' intention to adopt contact tracing apps.
Conclusions
The current study gives insights on both drivers and barriers to the adoption of contract tracing applications. Various theoretical and practical implications of significance are provided for academicians and practitioners to effectively promote app adoption to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.}

This study aims to identify the prominent risk factors and causal relationships among them by considering the petroleum industry's upstream, midstream, and downstream. The literature was scrutinized, and the main criteria were identified, which were filtered by the expert's panel. Five main criteria and the fifteen sub-criteria were selected for the final assessment of the risk identification and interaction of risk factors. The study has implemented an integrated MCDM techniques rough set theory and DEMATEL. This integrated method uses a flexible rough number to control the impreciseness and ambivalence. The result shows that fluctuation in the crude oil price, quality of products, and inability to anticipate market change are the prominent risk factors for sustainable PSC. Moreover, the study might help practitioners, policymakers, and academicians to emphasize their effort toward risk assessment of sustainable PSC.}

abstract = {Digitalization is a megatrend that affects and transforms societal, economic, and environmental processes on a global scale. Driven by a combination of technological advances as well as shifting societal demands, digitalization also affects the operation and planning of the electricity sector. This paper uses megatrend analysis framework to analyze digitalization phenomena, its regional differences, technologies, use cases and challenges. It highlights potential system-level benefits (e.g., increased efficiency, transparency, consumer participation) and challenges (e.g., electricity demand growth, autonomy loss, increasing cyber risks) currently reported in the literature. Eventually, building on the thorough analysis, we present a menu of policy options to exploit its full potential of digitalized electricity systems while mitigating adverse effects on decarbonization goals and consumers.}

abstract = {Digital technologies (DT) help decision-makers cope with disruptive events and, consequently, boost the resilience of healthcare supply chains (HSC). However, previous studies on HSC have not focused on the types of resilience capabilities supported by respective DT or taken a holistic perspective of resilience from both proactive and reactive dimensions. In order to address this gap, we conducted a study of eight healthcare organizations based on semi-structured interviews with 15 HSC managers and document analysis. As a result, we identified 14 DT, such as big data analytics, predictive health data analysis, and remote monitoring of inventories. These DT supported organizational capabilities of resilient HSC, such as long-term collaborative planning and strategic alliances based on trust and shared goals. These findings were articulated in a framework that describes what and how technology adoption improves HSC resilience. We also present four research propositions for theory-testing in future studies, which stress that the relationship between DT and the four major potentials of resilient systems (i.e., anticipating, responding, monitoring and learning) is mediated by organizational resilience capabilities. The framework is expected to offer guidance and ideas for managers and policy-makers interested in designing and operating resilient HSC.}
