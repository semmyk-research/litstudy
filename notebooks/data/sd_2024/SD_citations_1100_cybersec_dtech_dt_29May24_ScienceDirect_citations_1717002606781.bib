However, its implementation poses considerable risks for SMEs in emerging economies. Based on a survey of industry experts and business leaders associated with implementing I4.0 in the dynamically evolving economy of India, this paper identifies and prioritises the critical risks linked with implementing I4.0 in SMEs. Empirical results using the Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process suggest a hierarchy of risks associated with SMEs' transition to I4.0, with financial and technological risks posing the most significant barriers to I4.0 adoption. The novel results presented here can enable strategy development to effectively manage the risks of implementing new technologies in emerging economy contexts.}

Using the theoretical lens of the mobilities paradigm, this study explored the social meanings, cultural practices, and structure of feelings that could influence adoption and use of AVs in New Zealand (NZ) cities. The data were collected from public NZ Facebook pages during the period 2015–2020 when the AV debate gained momentum. Qualitative content analysis was conducted for a dataset drawn from 57 Facebook posts with over 4200 comments. The findings show that AVs are associated with meanings of safety, (un)employment, freedom, and control. The findings show how a society's car culture influences the adoption and ownership of AVs. They also show how AVs may increase productivity by introducing new practices while on the move such as eating, applying makeup, reading, or working, suggesting that travel time in AVs is not ‘dead’ time. The findings also uncover new aspects of how and why the public could develop trust in AVs. Overall, NZ society tends to be inclined towards accepting AVs with lower automation levels to maintain the pleasure of driving and allow the exploration of unplanned destinations. This study contributes to the mobilities paradigm by enriching our understanding of the diversified meanings and competencies associated with the adoption of AVs and draws attention to ways in which social meanings could be incorporated in AV policy interventions to better inform urban planning and infrastructure decisions that would shape the smart cities of the future.}

abstract = {Although the ongoing digital transformation offers new opportunities for organizations, more emphasis on information security is needed due to the evolving cyber-threat landscape. Despite all preventive measures, security incidents cannot entirely be mitigated. Organizations must establish incident response management to treat inevitable incidents in a structured manner and under considerable time pressure. If not handled, incidents can result in reputational or financial losses and disrupt business continuity. Especially organizations that have not addressed incident response management extensively need to understand which capabilities are required to develop their incident response management. However, research still lacks a practice-grounded and socio-technical conceptualization of those capabilities and their development. For such challenges, maturity models have proven valuable in practice and research. This paper follows a design science research approach to develop an incident response management maturity model (IRM3) closely aligned with practice requirements under a socio-technical lens. Iteratively applying and evaluating the IRM3 with seven real-world organizations leverages its comprehensive view based on four focus areas and 29 capability dimensions to understand which capabilities organizations need to approach incident response management. Building on existing research, this work provides a comprehensive perspective on incident response management and its associated capabilities. For practitioners, especially in organizations with initial incident response maturity, the IRM3 offers descriptive value when used as a status quo assessment tool and prescriptive value by outlining capabilities for successful incident response management.}

The challenges that the health systems face in the last years increased exponentially. No matter if we are talking about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or the Russian military action in Ukraine, the European health ecosystem is facing new problems. In the light of these uncertainties, we assessed which could be the next trends that can impact the healthcare systems, in order to better prepare and adapt to the new contexts. Using two foresights exercises (FSE), one in 2018 and the second one in 2022, we had identified the most important trends in the political, economic, social, technological, security, environmental and medical sectors that could have an impact on health. Fifty-three people participated in the first FSE and 40 in the second one. The respondents identified cyber security, an increased reliance on digital technologies for communications, CBRNE management of the patients, centrally coordinated attacks, demographic aging, reduced economic resources, violence against emergency medical staff and the increased need and demand for psychosocial support as the most important trends. Moreover, they considered that wars, hybrid threats, the fake news, pandemics and the influence of artificial intelligence could impact the healthcare systems. Many of the trends identified in 2018 as having a possible impact on the health system proved to be relevant four years later. Therefore, we consider the FSE a relevant tool in foreseeing the main areas that could have an impact on health and its results could guide the preparedness for the future.
Résumé
Les défis auxquels les systèmes de santé se sont confrontés pendant ces dernières années ont augmenté de façon exponentielle. Qu’il s’agisse de l’impact de la pandémie de COVID-19 ou de l’action militaire russe en Ukraine, l’écosystème européen de la santé est confronté à de nouveaux problèmes. Au regard de ces incertitudes, nous avons évalué quelles pourraient être les prochaines tendances pouvant impacter les systèmes de santé, afin de mieux se préparer et s’adapter aux nouveaux contextes. À l’aide de deux exercices de prospective (FSE), l’un en 2018 et le second en 2022, nous avons identifié les tendances les plus importantes dans les secteurs politique, économique, social, technologique, sécuritaire, environnemental et médical qui pourraient avoir un impact sur la santé. Cinquante trois personnes ont participé au premier FSE et 40 au second. Le répondants ont identifié la cybersécurité, la dépendance aux technologies digitales pour les communications, la gestion des patients NRBCE, les attaques coordonnées de manière centralisée, le vieillissement démographique, la réduction des ressources économiques, la violence contre le personnel médical d’urgence et le besoin et la demande accrus de soutien psychosocial comme les tendances les plus importantes. De plus, ils ont considéré que les guerres, les menaces hybrides, les informations fallacieuses, les pandémies et l’influence de l’intelligence artificielle pourraient avoir un impact sur les systèmes de santé. Bon nombre des tendances identifiées en 2018 comme ayant un impact possible sur le système de santé se sont avérées pertinentes quatre ans plus tard. Par conséquent, nous considérons le FSE comme un outil pertinent pour prévoir les principaux domaines qui pourraient avoir un impact sur la santé et ses résultats pourraient guider la préparation pour l’avenir.}

The recent decades have witnessed a progressive increase of global supply chains that have been related to most produced goods. Within this phenomenon, transport security has gained more and more importance, also because of the threats coming from organised crime and international terrorist groups. In this context, many stimuli have fostered investments on innovative technologies involving all transport modes. Some innovations are mode-specific while others are common to all of them, as in the case of cyber-security. On the basis of a thorough review of the literature, the main aim of the paper is to consider the impact of transport security innovations on supply chains, especially in terms of time and of economic costs. It emerges that momentous consequences can be generated by a security breach for all the firms and regions whose economic activities are reliant on the supply chain. The main implications of the analysis are that it is then necessary a coordination and collaboration among several private and public stakeholders, not only at the local and national level, but also at the supranational level. Moreover, the trade-off which may exist between the implementation of stricter security protocols and the impact on the speed and on the cost of supply chain activities must be taken into account.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has unprecedentedly entangled the physical world with cyber technologies and its integration with building infrastructure (BI) is no different. Integration of IoT can impart BI with upscale features like remote operations, automated management and user-centric facilities by developing an interconnected cognitive building (CB) ecosystem. However, this integration has entered an ambiguous phase of realizing mature adoption and practical utilization of IoT in BI for both academic and industrial domains. This ambiguity restricts the IoT and BI stakeholders to comprehend and acknowledge the full operational competency of IoT in BI. Thus, a significant research gap exists that deeply investigates the practical implementation and mature adoption of IoT in BI. The prime objective of this study is to establish a comprehensive review by exploring the state-of-art academic, technological and industrial research to identify major technological and behavioural interventions that successfully enhance the integration of IoT in BI. Besides, this study also highlights significant technical and non-technical challenges that require substantial research efforts for maturing the adoption of IoT in BI. The findings of the study argue that the full operational competency of IoT in BI is not yet realized and a dedicated effort from both IoT and BI stakeholders is required to provide modern BI with a generic IoT framework having cognitive intelligence and context-aware computing capabilities. The proposed study will assist the researchers in realizing the full operational competency of IoT in BI for more exciting innovations.}

However, a holistic review of blockchain application in building a cyber-secure supply chain remains elusive, which can impede the advancement of the field when competing arguments are made, and pure replications are initiated. Therefore, the present study carries a systematic literature review to assess the state of literature review on the significance of blockchain in developing a cyber-secure and resilient supply chain. A systematic review of 122 peer-reviewed papers published between 2012 and 2022 has been conducted using a structured methodological approach. Further, the Theory, Context and Methodology (TCM) framework has been applied to suggest avenues for future research. Our analysis reveals six dominant themes related to blockchain and its adoption, blockchain application for resilience, blockchain application for cyber-security, blockchain and its role in intermediation, disintermediation and reintermediation, challenges of blockchain adoption and benefits of blockchain applications in the supply chain. Although the role of blockchain application in the cyber secure and resilient supply chain has been recognised, very little attention has been given to contextual factors affecting its adoption and consequences on key performance parameters. The present study contributes to the literature by synthesising the prime findings of reviewed papers and the managerial implications, thereby giving a holistic view of the existing research and presenting an array of future opportunities for firms to adopt blockchain technology in the supply chain.}

With the rapid growing number of orders via e-shops and demanding customer requirements, even delivery services are forced to keep up with the times and not be afraid to implement innovative technologies and systems in their processes. New delivery options, such as delivery using drones or autonomous vehicles, are starting to come to the fore in the field of parcel delivery by postal operators around the world. This brings with it not only possible benefits, but also obstacles that companies must solve. However, for the successful implementation of such technologies, it is necessary to understand the behavior and requirements of potential customers, who have different opinions on the issue and may have respect and fear towards adopting innovations. The paper defines the basic characteristics of drone and autonomous vehicle delivery options.

Amplified by the speed and scope of social media, they can quickly reach millions of people and result in a wide range of marketplace deceptions. However, extant understandings of deepfakes’ implications in the marketplace are limited and fragmented. Against this background, we develop insights into the significance of deepfakes for firms and consumers—the threats they pose, how to mitigate those threats, and the opportunities they present. Our findings indicate that the main risks to firms include damage to image, reputation, and trustworthiness and the rapid obsolescence of existing technologies. However, consumers may also suffer blackmail, bullying, defamation, harassment, identity theft, intimidation, and revenge porn. We then accumulate and present knowledge on the strategies and mechanisms to safeguard against deepfake-based marketplace deception. Furthermore, we uncover and report the various legitimate opportunities offered by this new technology. Finally, we present an agenda for future research in this emergent and highly critical area.}

abstract = {Data-driven and integrated urban water management have been proposed to reduce surface water pollution in light of climate change and urbanization impacts. Besides technological innovation, data-driven and integrated management require information exchange among many actors, e.g., operators, engineers, or authorities. With the aim of achieving a more profound understanding of socio-technical infrastructures, such as urban water systems, I draw on the approach of socio-technical networks to study actors and infrastructure elements as well as multiple relations in-between. In this article, I investigate whether underlying socio-technical dependencies influence social interactions such as information exchange. More specifically related to data-driven and integrated management, I analyze potential challenges, such as organizational fragmentation, data access, and diverging perceptions. Based on empirical data from three case studies in Switzerland, I provide inferential results obtained from fitting exponential random graph models. Findings showed that actors’ relatedness to infrastructure elements affects their information exchange. Among the cases, the presence of the three challenges varied and is potentially contingent upon system size, organizational form, or progress in terms of data-driven and integrated management. Thus, incorporating a socio-technical perspective on social actors and infrastructure elements could help to improve policy design and implementation aiming to achieve more sustainable cities.}

Drawing on an in-depth single case study, including 19 interviews with a manufacturing firm in the German automotive industry and five of the suppliers and customers in the focal firm’s supply chain, the study identifies the following knowledge-sharing approaches that facilitate the adoption of Industry 4.0: 1) knowledge-sharing through principles; 2) upstream flow of knowledge; 3) strategic positioning; and 4) application-relatedness. These approaches are shown to be influenced both by company-related factors and relational factors. Applying a knowledge-based view of the firm, this study addresses a gap in current research by investigating the role of knowledge-sharing in adopting Industry 4.0 from the perspectives not only of a single focal firm but also of upstream and downstream suppliers and customers in the supply chain. In presenting approaches to knowledge-sharing that promote the implementation of Industry 4.0 based on a firm's existing resources, this study is also of direct relevance to practitioners.}

Nevertheless, considering the quick evolution of these technologies and its massive adoption, the current literature is still incipient on how innovations are translated into practice, with limited empirical evidence of its effectiveness, problems, and applications in digital healthcare. In fact, despite a considerably growing body of research literature on the use of new technologies in healthcare there is no systematic analysis on the practice of DT in healthcare systems. We believe that a literature review to fill this gap is important and pertinent, especially through the lens of applications, benefits, opportunities, and threats to analyze the status of these implementations and its impact in healthcare systems. We chose to perform a systematic literature review because it is a methodology that reviews previous literature and bring the field together, with rigor, concision, and minimal room for subjectivity, offering transparency in data collection and results with a higher level of objectivity and reproducibility. We expect to advance the understanding of the development of technical innovations in healthcare ecosystem and support scholars and practitioners to further explore empirical evidence of the effectiveness of digital applications in healthcare. We also offer a research agenda based on a bibliographic coupling analysis that identifies theoretical trends in the field researched and indicated four clusters with the most relevant themes of literature: IoT and Cloud computing, Data security, Healthcare structure, and Blockchain.}

Data is an essential means of monitoring the behaviour of the products and their users for optimisation purposes. It is in the digital sector that data is already commonly used to identify new opportunities, to support decision-making and to reduce development time. To replicate this process with physical products, novel design approaches based on data are emerging. Designers need to anticipate from the early stages of product design the right data to capture and analyse. However, research is still in its infancy and faces numerous challenges. Thus, the question addressed in this article is: “what are the challenges of data-driven design research in the early phases of the physical product development process?” A workshop involving 10 researchers was held to answer this question. In addition, a campaign of 12 interviews with connected products manufacturers completed this research. Through a literature review, the workshop and the campaign of interviews, this article synthesises both a scientific and an industrial outlook on the challenges of data driven design.

This difficulty is particularly pronounced for senior IS managers, such as CIOs and IT Vice Presidents, who tend to have scarce time and limited project-related knowledge but are ultimately held accountable for IS project performance. Focusing on this under-researched controller category, the study at hand contributes new insights into the enactment of controls by exploring how IS project uncertainty affects senior IS managers' control-style choices, as well as how it moderates the impact of such choices on process and product performance. Based on a survey of 150 senior IS managers, we find that IS project uncertainty increases managers' use of an authoritative control style but is unrelated to their use of an enabling control style. Further, in IS projects characterized by uncertainty, an authoritative control style is found to be effective for process performance, whereas an enabling style is found to be effective for product performance. Moreover, the results of a post-hoc analysis show that using the two control styles simultaneously under uncertainty delivers no discernible benefits, suggesting a decision-related control dilemma. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.}

Implementing a highly latent data exchange, especially with low eavesdropping/discovery probability, is challenging for practical scenarios, such as social and political movements in authoritarian regimes, military operations, and privacy preservation. Moreover, the current literature suffers from a low embedding capacity and monolingual applicability, limiting the amount of hiding secret data within short text messages using state-of-the-art algorithms, e.g., linguistic-based, structural-based, or coverless-based solutions. In this paper, we present a systematic covert communication technique called CovertSYS that enables a multilingual secure end-to-end conversation via messaging or social network platforms. The CovertSYS functions by encrypting a confidential message using a multi-factor authentication scheme and converting the encoded binary data into hidden Unicode symbols to be transmitted under cover of short text messages. We then conduct extensive experiments to confirm the security and validity of the proposed technique against state-of-the-art approaches. Our experimental results show that the CovertSYS provides a superior mean performance of 91.53% by improving the criteria scores: embedding capacity rate of 100%, imperceptibility rate of 76.4%, and distortion robustness rate of 98.2%. Finally, we discuss the practical implications of the proposed technique compared to the existing text steganography methods.}

Using data covering 1,166 listed manufacturing firms in China during 2008–2019, we apply the ordinary least squares method to verify that enterprise digitalization can positively affect green innovation, and absorptive capacity mediates this relationship. Moreover, we find that green credit strengthens the positive relationship between absorptive capacity and green innovation.

Based on semi-structured interviews with senior executives of liner shipping companies, this study explores the current digital maturity levels, the opportunities provided by digitalization and the underlying challenges that hinder its implementation in the liner shipping segment within the larger maritime logistics industry and identifies the essential leading strategies of digitalization in this segment. The digital maturity categories applied to liner shipping provide an opportunity for practitioners in this industry to evaluate their business functions’ digital maturity levels. Furthermore, based on interview data, digital transformation for the maritime logistics industry is defined, as well as 9 major barriers and 19 different pathways to digital transformation are identified. Understanding the key challenges and success factors in the industry is a key to approaching digitalization problems and developing a healthy digital transformation process.}

We show that the counting process of the data-breach incidents is adequately modelled by the Markov-modulated non-homogeneous Poisson process (MMNPP) whilst the logarithm of the breach sizes is well-captured by the generalised Pareto distribution. The cyber insurance premium per institution and two risk measures Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Average VaR are obtained. The computed results indicate that cyber insurance policies with longer maturity are more cost effective. A comprehensive analysis, parameter estimation and implementation of the MMNPP to model cyber risks are underscored as the principal contributions of this research.

While all digital (smart) inhalers record adherence, these are distinguished by their compatibility with commercial inhalers, capabilities to guide inhaler technique, use of patient-reported outcomes, and user-friendliness for both the healthcare professional (HCP) and patient. Due to the complexity and novelty of employing digital inhalers, collaboration with multiple entities within health systems is necessary and a well-planned integration is needed. For HCPs and patients, cybersecurity and privacy are critical, it will require review by each healthcare organization. In the US, some payers reimburse for remote monitoring using digital inhalers, but reimbursement is currently unavailable in other countries. There are several models for remote patient care, as employing an active, ongoing digital interface between the HCP and patient or they may choose to only review data at clinical encounters. Personalization of therapies and feedback are key to success. While digital inhaler malfunction uncommonly occurs, patient attrition over a year is significant. Some patients will be challenged to use digital platforms or have the necessary technology. Additional research is needed to address cost-effectiveness, in vivo accuracy of inspiratory measurement capable devices, ability to teach inhaler technique, their application for monitoring lung function, and lastly real-world adoption and implementation in routine clinical practice.}

In this article, we review the literature to identify common themes and concerns related to the adoption of AI technologies in the context of I4.0 in several industry sectors. AI solutions are discussed in the context of an AI adoption pipeline that spans data collection, processing, model construction, and interpretation of results. Our findings indicate that although different industries share common issues, the adopted solutions are often specific to a particular industry sector, which may be difficult to transfer to other sectors. Moreover, industry sectors may pursue different adoption strategies due to varying experience and maturity of AI practices. These findings may inform managers, practitioners, and decision-makers who are involved in the adaptation of Industry 4.0 transformation in their respective industry sectors.}

However, the I4.0 concept also comprises broader changes in the company's business model (BM) through digital transformation, which deserves more attention, especially from the technology providers' perspective. As they are essential to advancing the digital transformation diffusion and creating I4.0 ecosystems, their business model innovation (BMI) in this context is a keystone for I4.0. Thus, we consider how changing factors in the I4.0 context affect the business model dimensions of technology providers. We analyze changing factors in the three main BM dimensions: front-end, back-end, and value proposition. We study ten I4.0 technology providers and explain the mechanisms of change involved in their BMI, explaining how and why such changes happen. The findings provide practitioners with insights to anticipate the necessary actions to manage and incorporate such changes, whether they rely more on data and IoT devices, new BMs such as training and consulting, dynamic pricing forms, new software/hardware, or service competencies. We also provide a detailed analysis of elements of change in the BM that can be used in theory to understand better the different digital transformation impacts in the Industry 4.0 context.}

For various governments to encourage carbon neutrality, there is a dire necessity for widespread research on the expansion of greener energy sources. This bibliometric review sheds light on the significant contributions in the field of energy transition research in the past four decades and suggests future research roadmaps. By compiling a map of scholarly publications on energy transition, this study uses the PRISMA technique and bibliometric software like VOS-viewer, cite-space, and R-Biblioshiny to map the research findings of scholarly publications listed in Scopus and Web of Science during 1981–2021. Our analysis shows that aspects like climate change, alternative energy, governance approach, and emission reduction are increasingly important. Further, areas that require future research include developing policy frameworks, energy infrastructure (storage and transfer), renewable energy ecosystem, clean energy economic analysis, and impact assessment for timely energy transition across the globe. Therefore, collaboration among nations and research institutions should be advanced with a particular focus on clean technology development and knowledge transfer for rapid energy transition across continents.}

This paper reports our work on an online social media analysis of a large-scale Twitter dataset, covering cyber security and privacy aspects of many different types of computing devices discussed by non-expert users in the real world. We developed two new machine learning based classifiers to automatically create the Twitter dataset with 435,207 tweets posted by 337,604 non-expert users in January and February of 2019, 2020 and 2021. We analyzed the dataset using both quantitative (topic modeling and sentiment analysis) and qualitative analysis methods, leading to various previously unknown findings. For instance, we observed a sharp (more than doubled) increase of non-expert users’ tweets on cyber security and privacy during the pandemic in 2021, compare to in the pre-COVID years (2019 and 2020). Our analysis revealed a diverse range of topics discussed by non-expert users, including VPNs, Wi-Fi, smartphones, laptops, smart home devices, financial security, help-seeking, and roles of different stakeholders. Overall negative sentiment was observed across almost all topics in all the three years. Our results indicate the multi-faceted nature of non-expert users’ perspectives on cyber security and privacy and call for more holistic, comprehensive and nuanced research on their perspectives.}

Nevertheless, the application of new methods/technologies, and developments in the field are not fully integrated into training/education programs. This study utilised a systematic literature review along with thematic and content analyses to interrogate and explore the developments within urban freight logistics practises and compared them with the current developments in the literature on freight logistics training/education programs—to identify the gaps and limitations within the body of knowledge. The findings reveal that the literature on urban freight logistics education is lacking in terms of providing a comprehensive education on the spatial systems of moving freight in urban areas and is falling behind the current developments within the industry. This study highlights that there is a substantial gap in the body of knowledge on urban freight logistics education, given that many of the current studies in the literature are focus on freight logistics as a topic with no/limited consideration to the rapidly changing urban context.}

Motivated by the large volume of literature, this study makes a tertiary review of Industry 4.0 (i4.0), identifying the main concepts, methods, and technologies. The study is guided by three research questions: What are the literature reviews on i4.0? What are the research questions of these reviews? What are the main results of i4.0 reviews? The reviewed articles are systematic review articles indexed in the Scopus and Web of Science databases. This study presents a descriptive analysis of the review articles (46 articles) and a second descriptive analysis of the references cited in them (1542 articles). In content analysis, we grouped the articles into three classes: conceptual articles, articles on enabling technologies, and articles that address operations management in i4.0. The reviewed articles show the multidisciplinary nature of the topic and the still relative scarcity of studies on its application in companies.}

Massachusetts General Hospital’s (MGH) Center for TeleHealth and Mass General Brigham's (MGB) Virtual Care Program are committed to hosting annual symposia on key topics related to virtual care. Subject matter experts across the country, health care organizations, and academic medical centers are invited to participate. The inaugural MGH/MGB Virtual Care Symposium, which focused on rethinking curriculum, competency, and culture in the virtual care era, was held on September 2, 2020. The second MGH/MGB Virtual Care Symposium was held on November 2, 2021, and focused on virtual care quality frameworks. Resultant topics were (1) guiding principles necessary for the future of virtual care measurement; (2) best practices deployed to measure quality of virtual care and how they compare and align with in-person frameworks; (3) evolution of quality frameworks over time; (4) how increased adoption of virtual care has impacted patient access and experience and how it has been measured; (5) the pitfalls and barriers which have been encountered by organizations in developing virtual care quality frameworks; and (6) examples of how quality frameworks have been applied in various use cases. Common elements of a quality framework for virtual care programs among symposium participants included improving the patient and provider experience, a focus on achieving health equity, monitoring success rates and uptime of the technical elements of virtual care, financial stewardship, and clinical outcomes. Virtual care represents an evolution in the access to care paradigm that helps keep health care aligned with other modern industries in digital technology and systems adoption. With advances in health care delivery models, it is vitally important that the quality measurement systems be adapted to include virtual care encounters. New methods may be necessary for asynchronous transactions, but synchronous virtual visits and consults can likely be accommodated in traditional quality frameworks with minimal adjustments. Ultimately, quality frameworks for health care will adapt to hybrid in-person and virtual care practices.}

While research on inequalities and injustices in energy transitions is growing, these issues remain less explored in the case of the digitalisation of the energy systems through smart grids and smart homes. This paper aims to synthetise our understandings of inequality, exclusion and vulnerability in energy transitions by systemically analysing different dimensions of marginalisation in the transition to a digitalised electricity infrastructure in Sweden. To synthetise understandings of marginalisation and exclusion, conceptualisations of these processes in different social science approaches to energy studies are reviewed. Moreover, an empirical analysis of interviews with a range of Swedish actors such as energy utilities, social housing developers or pensioner organisations is carried out and enriched by previous research on smart grid users. The empirical analysis demonstrates what specific forms that diverse categories of marginalisation, as already identified generally in different social science approaches to energy studies, may take in smart grids. We argue that marginalisation of household users in smart grids may take place along multiple dimensions, relating to matters of literacy, participation, infrastructure, and the economy. The analysis suggests that bundles of marginalisation aspects concerning household users in sustainable energy transitions should be recognised and addressed simultaneously.}

In response, the Chinese government has introduced digitalisation policies that clearly embrace the use of information and communication technologies in health. To enhance data protection in this tide of digital transformation, China adopted its first ever standalone data protection legislation in 2021, the Personal Information Protection Law, which is expected to have huge impacts on technology and data processing. This paper captures these significant changes related to technological advances and regulatory approaches. It aims to explore the interplay between China's new data protection legal regime and the digital health advances which were proposed to facilitate healthcare in an ageing society. To do so, the paper first reviews and categorises the use of digital tools for various health functions and argues that the use of digital health technologies creates significant data protection concerns. The paper then investigates to what extent China's data protection rules mitigate privacy risks created by digital health technologies. An evolutionary overview of China's data protection legal landscape is mapped out. On this basis, outstanding legal issues surrounding health data protection are explored, contributing to a nuanced analysis of health data processing under different scenarios including: (1) healthcare provision; (2) health research; (3) public health; (4) social care and health management in a non-medical context; and (5) real-world data for market approval. The paper shows that the Personal Information Protection Law renders China's data protection legal landscape less fragmented and offers important legal safeguards for health data. Despite legislative advances, a closer look at relevant provisions in the Personal Information Protection Law and their interplay with other regulations reveals areas where further clarification is needed, including the definition of health data, the meaning of ‘separate consent’, data minimisation requirements for health apps, and the operation of the enforcement mechanism. The paper ends with indicating potential steps forward, with a hope that the benefits of digital health can be realised in a manner that respects privacy and human dignity.}

Modern innovative models have the possibility of transferring research and development (R&D) output through technology transfer from scientific and research institutions or other enterprises. The complex process of technology transfer is significantly dependent on cooperation among academia, industry, and governments (I4.0) in response to the technological developments driven together through Industry 4.0. As a result, numerous technology transfer factors must be addressed for I4.0 to become a reality. However, the abundance of literature on I4.0 and associated technologies, the key ingredients, and insights for effectively executing I4.0 technology transfer are fairly limited. This study focuses on the success factors of technology transfer for I4.0. The framework is based on systematic literature to outline significant results and factors. Furthermore, this study summarizes, analysis, and criticizes the actual models and their influential variables for I4.0 technology transfer. One of the findings of this study is the significance of cooperation between technology recipients, agents, and inventors for I4.0 technology transfer. Another impressive finding is the significance of the ecosystem component in technology transfer. Combining I4.0 technologies and open innovation is a game-changer, enabling businesses to significantly save time and cost. This article will assist decision-makers in developing policies and strategies to improve the I4.0 technology transfer process. Furthermore, this involves identifying the kind of government assistance that will help accelerate the transition to I4.0 via technology transfer.}

Historically, quality definitions evolved over time but with significant domain-specific differences. One example of these emerging differences is the human-centric, subjective approach to quality. Current Quality 4.0 models, in most cases, are derivatives from the Total Quality Management (TQM) way, solely based on hopes for Data-Driven approaches to solving problems, with the lack of a human-centric operator approach. Industry 4.0 and its associated digital technologies promise to change this notion and make formerly subjective quality dimensions measurable on a scale as input for design and manufacturing. This leads to an opportunity to bridge the current gap and streamline the Quality and Operator in a holistic, data-informed, and digital technology-enabled way. This paper introduces a Quality 4.0 transformation as a vision for the future of Human – Machine symbiosis in the context of Operator 5.0 for intelligent manufacturing systems. We discuss what needs to be added to Quality 4.0 to achieve the requirements set for Operator 5.0 This work suggests how to enrich smart manufacturing systems from a human-centric perspective with Operator 5.0 making own, informed decisions based on data, experience, and tacit knowledge.}

abstract = {Understanding how Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies complement each other on one side, and human skills on the other, is an increasingly important concern for managers and policymakers alike: it is essential for the optimization of firm-level sociotechnical interactions as much as it is vital to smoothen the digital transition on a global scale. However, firm-level evidence on patterns of conjoint adoption of I4.0 technologies and their relationship with skills is still scant. The present work contributes to covering this gap by leveraging a large cross-sectional database of Italian firms. Distinguishing between digital and physical I4.0 technologies, we find that companies are primarily (though not exclusively) driven toward either the former or the latter category of technologies. Additionally, we find that both the adoption of digital I4.0 technologies and the adoption of physical ones lead to the upskilling of non-ICT employees alongside ICT-specialized personnel. However, small firms seem to be constrained in their ability to follow the same upskilling strategy as their larger counterparts. This may have key practical implications, especially in the context of recent industrial policies enacted at the European level.}

As the term CPS suggests, the advanced production systems are made of a digital element and a physical one that work together to reach the desired functionality. The virtual element is made of various entities that are typically generically described as “a digital representation of a physical system”. However, this general definition often is referred to terms that are actually belonging to different concepts. These terms are Metaverse, Digital Twin, Digital Thread, and Asset Administration Shell. These terms often are independently used in literature and industrial initiatives without any clear understanding of how they relate to one another or what they signify. This paper wants to contribute to the scientific discussion on these concepts and aims at analyzing their meanings and key features through a literature study, by proposing a hierarchical view on the relationships between them, their roles and functions for CPS-based production systems.}

However, the question of how to engage children with coding activities within the context and limitations of the curriculum remains relatively explored. In our study, a human-centered design approach was followed to guide a small group of children through the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a board game. The board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. A mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. The tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. Tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children. Our study shows that using such games by connecting the mathematics curriculum with coding problems can successfully engage participants in collaborative computational thinking activities. We contribute to the field by providing human-centered guidance for the creation of educational tools to develop computational thinking. Such guidance is not only applicable in technologically rich environments; it can also be applied in educational communities with limited access to technology.}

Based on an Integrative Literature Review and adopting a Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM), we propose a distributed approach for real-time inferencing in edge near the data sources for rapid autonomous decisioning and recovery planning under disruption. We develop a framework for building resilience in the supply chain using real-time distributed information sharing in a collaborative partner ecosystem. Visibility across the supply chain is ensured with a Digital Control Tower by making information available to any connected node for synchronized action. The important contribution of this research is building a real-time decision framework for sustainable resilience-building in resource-constrained organizations unable to invest in big data and enterprise systems. A set of design propositions following the CIMO framework is expected to help scholars and practitioners alike. A research agenda is provided for the researchers to take forward hypothesis formulation and empirical validation on the basis of the propositions. (194 words)}

This paper investigates the potential interventions and disruptive impacts that Industry 4.0 technologies may have on pharmaceutical Circular SCs (CSCs). To accomplish this, a novel method involving a literature review and Pythagorean fuzzy-Delphi has initially been employed to identify and screen categorized lists of Industry 4.0 Disruptive Technologies (IDTs) and their impacts on pharmaceutical CSC. Subsequently, the weight of finalized impacts and the performance score of finalized IDTs have simultaneously been measured via a novel version of Pythagorean fuzzy SECA (Simultaneously Evaluation of Criteria and Alternatives). Then, the priority of each intervention for disruptive impacts of Industry 4.0 has been determined via the Hanlon method. This is one of the first papers to provide in-depth insights into advancing the study of the disruptive action of Industry 4.0 technologies cross-fertilizing CE throughout pharmaceutical SCs in the emerging economy of Iran. The results indicate that digital technologies such as Big Data Analytics, Global Positioning Systems, Enterprise Resource Planning, and Digital Platforms are quite available in the Irans' pharmaceutical industry. These technologies, along with four available interventions, e.g., environmental regulations, subsidy, fine, and reward, would facilitate moving towards a lean, agile, resilient, and sustainable supply chain through the efficient utilization of resources, optimized waste management, and substituting the human workforce by machines.}

This study aims to review Industry 4.0 and agri-food sustainability research published in the last decade. Text classification and data extraction machine learning techniques have been used to support the literature review process. Notably, text classification was used to support the screening phase of titles and abstracts, while data extraction was used to support the content analysis phase by identifying the main topics on which documents are focused. The descriptive analysis shows a summary of the leading scientific journals in the research field, as well as the most influential countries and the research topic evolution over time. The results of the study allowed us to identify ten main research clusters, providing in-depth discussions and perspectives on critical areas for future research avenues. Finally, this study provides significant implications for the agri-food industry, suggesting firms redesign their business models according to a logic that prioritises long-term, shared value creation over short-term efficiency, and profitability. Incorporating digital technologies may help control farming activities' impact on soil and air quality, minimising the use of natural resources, pollutants, and CO2 emissions, thus providing long-term economic, environmental, and social advantages.}

The article substantiates the existence of convergence processes in the field of digitization of countries, taking into account the number of Internet users; people with advanced skills; and indicators of infrastructure (network coverage, population covered by at least a 3G mobile network, population covered by at least a 4G mobile network), access (access to ICT at home, active mobile broadband subscriptions, fixed broadband subscriptions), enablers (fixed broadband over 10 Mbps, mobile data and voice basket, high consumption) and barriers (improved broadband access from 256 kbps to 2 Mbps and from 2 Mbps to 10 Mbps mobile data and voice basket, low consumption) of digital development. The methodological basis for determining the sigma convergence of digitization processes is the coefficient of variation. The values of the coefficient of variation confirmed the high level of convergence between the studied countries in terms of the degree of use of the Internet for conducting digital transactions. The developed econometric model, which describes the influence of statistically significant integral indicators of the national cybersecurity level, ease of doing business, and the anti-money laundering index on the country’s digital development level, made it possible to determine the average trend of dependence on the level of digital development. One hundred four countries were considered for the analysis. The conducted study of the impact of digitalization on economic transformations based on developed quantile regressions made it possible to analyze exactly how the level of digital development for countries with a high level of digitalization and for countries with a low level of digitalization development depends on the value of the national cybersecurity indicator and the ease of doing business, and which countries have the least resistance to the risk factors of their involvement in fraudulent schemes for the purpose of legalizing criminal income.}

A thorough exploration and classification of blockchain techniques used for DDoS attack mitigation are not explored in the prior art. This paper reviews and categorizes state-of-the-art DDoS mitigation solutions based on blockchain technology. The DDoS mitigation techniques are classified based on the solution deployment location i.e. network-based, near attacker location, near victim location, and hybrid solutions in the network architecture with emphasis on the IoT and SDN architectures. Additionally, based on our study, the research challenges and future directions to implement the blockchain based DDoS mitigation solutions are discussed.}

The benefits of deep learning (DL) are manifold, but it comes with limitations that have – so far – interfered with widespread industry adoption. This paper explains why DL – despite its popularity – has difficulties speeding up its adoption within business analytics. It is shown that the adoption of deep learning is not only affected by computational complexity, lacking big data architecture, lack of transparency (black-box), skill shortage, and leadership commitment, but also by the fact that DL does not outperform traditional ML models in the case of structured datasets with fixed-length feature vectors. Deep learning should be regarded as a powerful addition to the existing body of ML models instead of a “one size fits all” solution. The results strongly suggest that gradient boosting can be seen as the go-to model for predictions on structured datasets within business analytics. In addition to the empirical study based on three industry use cases, the paper offers a comprehensive discussion of those results, practical implications, and a roadmap for future research.}

abstract = {Background
Electronic medical record (EMR) adoption across healthcare necessitates a purposeful curriculum design to prepare graduates for the delivery of safe and effective patient care in digitally-enabled environments.
Objective
To describe the design and development of an Interprofessional Electronic Medical Record (iEMR) subject that introduces healthcare students to its utility in clinical settings.
Methods
A six-stage design-based educational research framework (Focus, Formulation, Contextualisation, Definition, Implementation, Evaluation) was used to instigate the iEMR design and development in nursing and five allied health graduate entry to practice (preregistration) degrees at an Australian university.
Results
In the Focus process, the concept and interdisciplinary partnerships were developed. The Formulation process secured grant support for subject design and development, including a rapid literature review to accommodate various course and curriculum structures. Discipline-specific subject themes were created through the Contextualisation process. During the Definition process, learning objectives and content resources were built. The Implementation process describes the pilot implementation in the nursing program, where assessment tasks were refined, and interdisciplinary clinical case studies originated.
Discussion
The design and development of an iEMR subject is underpinned by internal support for educational innovation and in alignment with digital health strategies in employer organisations. Identified barriers include faculty-level changes in strategic support for teaching innovation, managerial expectations of workload, the scope of work required by academics and learning designers, and the gap between the technology platform required to support online learning and the infrastructure needed to support simulated EMR use. A key discovery was the difficulty of finding EMR software, whether designed for teaching purposes or for clinical use, that could be adapted to meet the needs of this project.
Conclusion
The lessons learned are relevant to educators and learning designers attempting a similar process. Issues remain surrounding the sustainability of the iEMR subject and maintaining academic responsibility for ongoing curriculum management.}

A quantitative methodology was used, during which strategic-level managers of Brazilian retail companies completed an electronic questionnaire. Cluster analysis was used to identify digital maturity levels. Five maturity dimensions—strategy, market, operations, culture, and technology—separate companies across maturity levels, with no dimension systematically achieving higher scores. Higher average scores for the culture dimension were found, which supports that culture is a driver of digital transformation. Larger companies were part of the cluster of digitally mature firms, and companies with lower digital maturity required greater investment in strategy and operations. This study characterizes the Brazilian retail sector in terms of digital maturity, which might be similar to other emerging economies. This study's theoretical contributions are grounded by dynamics capabilities theory, suggesting that a company must develop capabilities related to five dimensions to achieve digital maturity, and thus competitive advantages. This study proposes a framework based on the structure-conduct-paradigm, which future research should explore further.}

Nonetheless, big data is analyzed by humans and a lack of virtue ethics could lead to disastrous consequences (erroneous decision-making can stem from bad data analysis resulting in not only huge business losses but also deterioration of relationships with suppliers and customers in the supply chain). To address the calls of previous researchers, this study utilizes the Ethical Theory of Organizing framework and Stakeholder theory to develop the theoretical model and further examine the relationships. The samples are drawn from the manufacturing industry. Hypothesis testing is executed through covariance-based structural equation modeling and finally, the conclusions are drawn.

The IoT ecosystem is subject to various access control complications due to the limited latency between IoT devices and the Internet, low energy requirements of IoT devices, the distributed framework, ad-hoc networks, and an exceptionally large number of heterogeneous IoT devices that need to be managed. The motivation for this proposed work is to resolve the incurring challenges of IoT associated with management and access control security. Each IoT domain implementation has particular features and needs separate access control policies to be considered in order to design a secure solution. This research work aims to resolve the intricacy of policies management, forged policies, dissemination, tracking of access control policies, automation, and central management of IoT nodes and provides a trackable and auditable access control policy management system that prevents forged policy dissemination by applying Software Defined Network (SDN) and blockchain technology in an IoT environment. Integration of SDN and blockchain provides a robust solution for IoT environment security. Recently, smart contracts have become one of blockchain technology’s most promising applications. The integration of smart contracts with blockchain technology provides the capability of designing tamper-proof and independently verifiable policies. In this paper, we propose a novel, scalable solution for implementing immutable, verifiable, adaptive, and automated access control policies for IoT devices together with a successful proof of concept that demonstrates the scalability of the proposed solution. The performance of the proposed solution is evaluated in terms of throughput and resource access delay between the blockchain component and the controller as well as from node to node. The number of nodes in the IoT network and the number of resource access requests were independently and systematically increased during the evaluations. The results illustrate that the resource access delay and throughput were affected neither linearly nor exponentially; hence, the proposed solution shows no significant degradation in performance with an increase in the number of nodes and/or requests.}

Advances in technological developments are proving to be a game changer for improving maintenance strategies and practices. However, several challenges related to the lack of adequate managerial aspects, and adoption of wrong approaches to this transformation hinder its success. Research has shown that technology alone is not sufficient for organizations to ensure the success of their digitalization attempts. Therefore, the aim of this research is to adopt a holistic approach to identify, evaluate and rank a comprehensive list of the various influencing variables, multifaceted in nature, that drive the success of maintenance DT initiatives. To that end, the authors solicited the different success factors based on a systematic literature review, then conducted a purification phase of these enablers and categorized them. Subsequently, a hybrid reactive Delphi approach, combined with AHP method, was adopted to evaluate and rank the success factors and their corresponding clusters through a panel of 17 highly qualified experts. The verified final list includes 41 factors mapped into 10 categories. The clusters are ranked according to their relative level of importance, and normalized weights are attributed to their factors. In particular, “Digital strategy - strategic alignment” cluster ranked highest followed by “Top management and leadership skills” then “Organizational development and change management”. The findings of this study contribute to enriching the extant literature, serve as a foundation to conduct further academic research, and provide proper guidance to practitioners in this field.}

Methods
As a guide to creating an equitable connected digital diabetes ecosystem, we propose a roadmap with key milestones that need to be achieved along the way.
Results
During the Coronavirus 2019 pandemic, there was an increased use of digital tools to support diabetes care, but at the same time, the pandemic also highlighted problems of inequities in access to and use of these same technologies. Based on these observations, a connected diabetes ecosystem should incorporate and optimize the use of existing treatments and technologies, integrate tasks such as glucose monitoring, data analysis, and insulin dose calculations, and lead to improved and equitable health outcomes.
Conclusions
Development of this ecosystem will require overcoming multiple obstacles, including interoperability and data security concerns. However, an integrated system would optimize existing devices, technologies, and treatments to improve outcomes.}

The following paper explores the development of a statistically based index evaluating digitalization processes to assess the digital divide between the regions of Kazakhstan: resource-based (oil and gas) regions and regions where the service sector dominates the GRP. As a method for forming such an indicator, the authors suggest using factor analysis, which reduces the dimension of factors while maintaining the reasoning behind a significant part of the data variability. This approach is preferable because the index is formed on the basis of statistically objective estimates rather than that of subjective expert opinion. The results of the factor analysis were interpreted as the following two qualitatively different subindices that formed the final Economy and Society Digitalization Index, namely, for resource-based (oil and gas) regions: subindex of digital consumption by households and subindex of digital consumption by organizations; for service-dominated regions: subindex of digital consumption by households and organizations, and subindex of digitalization of labor management processes. The combined values of the calculated subindices allowed us to conclude that the introduction of information and communication technologies into the consumer environment is greater than into the activities of economic entities. Open innovations are revealed to create additional opportunities for obtaining new knowledge and additional tools and ideas that can lead to bridging the digital divide in the regions of Kazakhstan. The analysis of descriptive statistics of these values allowed us to draw a number of conclusions available that can be used to form regional digital policy. First, the regional population shows a fairly homogeneous high level of consumption of telecommunications services, which indicates their availability. Second, the majority of economic entities throughout the country have successfully passed the first stage of digitalization, which consists in the use of Internet technologies; although, not all of them are characterized by a trend toward the digitalization of business processes. Thirdly, for most organizations, the digital development of human capital still remains an important task. Further statistical research of regional differentiation of the values of the proposed digital development indicator will allow a deeper understanding of the reasons for the digital divide in Kazakhstan.}

This research is conducted in three phases using a bottom-up approach. The early, transition and mature stage characteristics of digital maturity are first identified using a systematic literature review. Subsequently, the characteristics are mapped to the New South Wales (NSW) Government's ten-point commitment to the construction sector to propose a conceptual framework, which is then applied to understand the current digital maturity of design and construction in NSW through an industry-wide questionnaire survey. The paper reveals a lack of clear understanding of the stages of digital maturity and proposes a strategic framework for digitalisation of design and construction (SFDDC) to guide systematic improvement. The SFDDC is a decadal framework that considers feasible levels of digitalisation of design and construction and is characterised by a series of baseline technologies and minimum targets at each stage. It is expected to be a catalyst towards digitally driven processes and integrated functional digital twins.}

We further identify five distinct course profiles that digital strategy modules typically follow. This article contributes to the strategic management discipline by providing an exploration of digital strategy teaching and offering concrete guidelines for teaching digital strategy in business schools and universities, either as a module on its own right or as part of an existing strategy module.}

abstract = {The emergence of digital transformation has changed the business landscape for the foreseeable future. As scholars advance their understanding and digital transformation begins to gain maturity, it becomes necessary to develop a synthesis to create solid foundations. To do so, significant steps need to be taken to critically, rigorously, and transparently examine the existing literature. Therefore, this article uses a meta-review with the support of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Protocol. As a result, we identified six dimensions and seventeen categories related to digital transformation. The organizational, technological, and social dimensions are still pivotal in digital transformation, while two new dimensions (sustainability and smart cities) still need to be explored in the existing literature. The need to deepen knowledge in digital transformation and refine the dimensions found is of paramount importance, as it involves some complexity due to organizational dynamics and the development of new technologies. It was also possible to identify opportunities, challenges, and future directions.}

abstract = {The concept of Smart Airport is emerging in the Aviation sector because of the industry 4.0 revolution. To provide the best facility to the air travelers, most of the airports have enhanced their infrastructure using smart automation and Cloud Services (CS), etc. which play a significant role in increasing the revenue of the aviation industry. As the use of digital technology at airports is increasing, they are becoming progressively vulnerable to cyber-attacks and data breaches. The data collected by the airports is stored in specialized cloud databases, which ensures the availability of the data at any time. However, cloud servers have been compromised several times which leads to a lack of trust by the consumers. To meet the privacy and security objectives of the data collected at the airports and stored in the cloud, this research proposes a Searchable Encryption (SE) scheme based on Partial Homomorphic Encryption (PHE). The proposed scheme allows users to search on the encrypted data stored in the cloud hence enhancing the usability of the encrypted data. In this paper, a Single Keyword Searchable Encryption (SKSE) scheme is presented which is implemented using Paillier Cryptosystem. The proposed scheme comprises of two variants (a) Secure SKSE (b) Efficient SKSE. The Secure SKSE scheme exploits the probabilistic properties of the Paillier cryptosystem, whereas, the Efficient SKSE scheme is lightweight as it is based on the deterministic properties of the Paillier cryptosystem. Both variants of SKSE scheme are deployed on a public cloud platform “Contabo” and tested on the real-world aviation data to assess the performance of both approaches. The security and performance analysis illustrates that the proposed Secure SKSE maintains a high-security level by providing probabilistic encryption and trapdoors. On the other hand, the Efficient SKSE is 84 times faster in terms of performance.}

abstract = {With the introduction of Industry 5.0, a new paradigm shift is planned. Whereas Industry 4.0 is still focused primarily on economic objectives to be achieved through digital transformation and automation of monotonous work processes, Industry 5.0 will also bring in social and ecological objectives. The focus is on holistic, sustainable, and human-centered value creation. Thus, the complexity of digitalization is increasing with the implementation of direct collaboration between humans and machines. In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are faced with major challenges as they have limited resources for implementing a successful digitalization strategy. This makes the use of maturity models (MMs) a valuable tool for shaping the strategically aligned digitalization transition of companies. In this context, this paper reviews whether the currently existing MMs for Industry 4.0 address the specific requirements of Industry 5.0, and sufficiently consider a human-centered approach along with the assessment of readiness for disruptive technologies in companies (especially SMEs). The study examines currently existing Industry 4.0 MMs as a part of a systematic literature review. A total of 297 German- and English-language publications were found and systematically investigated, of which 24 MMs provided sufficient scientific information in the end. These were categorized using a self-developed evaluation matrix. Furthermore, they were evaluated and discussed regarding their human-centered approach and applicability to SMEs. Through the analysis, key characteristics for Industry 4.0 MMs were identified, which can serve as a basis for the development of an Industry 5.0 assessment for SMEs.}

Although digital maturity models (DMM) have been developed for different sectors in the literature, such studies in the defense industry are lacking due to sector-specific dynamics. This study aims to close this gap and proposes a digital maturity model specific to the defense industry. In this study, a novel model was developed that combines the SF-AHP and SF-TODIM methods due to the uncertainty and hesitancy contained in the evaluation. The validity of the presented novel model has been demonstrated in a prominent defense company in Turkey. According to the results, the most notable digital maturity dimensions are the evaluation of opportunities and alignment with stakeholders. In addition, the model indicates that the company owns the required soft skills, such as leadership, organizational culture, and strategic determination for digital transformation (DT). On the other hand, essential hard skills such as technology and operational competencies are yet to be improved. Lastly, sensitivity and comparison analyses are conducted to validate and verify the obtained results’ stability and robustness.}

With the aim to explore the factors for the policy conflicts, this article selects the United States, the European Union, China, and India as typical cases to analyze their trade development strategies and digital trade rules comparatively. We find that the four economies adopt differentiated digital trade policies and data governance approaches on the basis of digital industrial benefits. We concluded that the government implements trade policies strategically to influence the distribution of digital trade gains and increase the share of the digital industry by intervening in cross-border data flows.

abstract = {Background
Digital health solutions that operate with or without artificial intelligence (D/AI) raise several responsibility challenges. Though many frameworks and tools have been developed, determining what principles should be translated into practice remains under debate. This scoping review aims to provide policymakers with a rigorous body of knowledge by asking: 1) what kinds of practice-oriented tools are available?; 2) on what principles do they predominantly rely?; and 3) what are their limitations?
Methods
We searched six academic and three grey literature databases for practice-oriented tools, defined as frameworks and/or sets of principles with clear operational explanations, published in English or French from 2015 to 2021. Characteristics of the tools were qualitatively coded and variations across the dataset identified through descriptive statistics and a network analysis.
Findings
A total of 56 tools met our inclusion criteria: 19 health-specific tools (33.9%) and 37 generic tools (66.1%). They adopt a normative (57.1%), reflective (35.7%), operational (3.6%), or mixed approach (3.6%) to guide developers (14.3%), managers (16.1%), end users (10.7%), policymakers (5.4%) or multiple groups (53.6%). The frequency of 40 principles varies greatly across tools (from 0% for ‘environmental sustainability’ to 83.8% for ‘transparency’). While 50% or more of the generic tools promote up to 19 principles, 50% or more of the health-specific tools promote 10 principles, and 50% or more of all tools disregard 21 principles. In contrast to the scattered network of principles proposed by academia, the business sector emphasizes closely connected principles. Few tools rely on a formal methodology (17.9%).
Conclusion
Despite a lack of consensus, there is a solid knowledge-basis for policymakers to anchor their role in such a dynamic field. Because several tools lack rigour and ignore key social, economic, and environmental issues, an integrated and methodologically sound approach to responsibility in D/AI solutions is warranted.}

An Internet of Things-enabled Smart Grid affords better automation, monitoring, and control of electricity consumption. However, rapid growth in connected entities, accompanied by electricity demand, brings about challenges such as securing energy information exchange before an incident occurs. It is argued that Smart Grid systems were designed with no regard for security, which is a serious omission for data, energy information exchange, and consumers’ and utilities’ privacy. This study is motivated by the gap identified between the requirements and controls for cybersecurity in the IoT-enabled Smart Grid's bidirectional data flow. It develops and confirms a model with seven security requirements and 45 security controls. In future, this model is to be verified and validated. This research focuses solely on the information flow's cybersecurity through using technical security controls to counter internet-based threats in IoT-enabled Smart Grids.}

An Industry 4.0-enabled manufacturing environment that offers real-time data gathering, transparency and analysis across all parts of a manufacturing process is known as cyber–physical systems, also known as cyber manufacturing. Data analytics enables executives to make data-driven choices and boost productivity, while automation speeds up manufacturing and decreases machine downtime. The main objective of deploying Industry 4.0 solutions is to enable manufacturing organisations to increase collaboration by making the correct information accessible to the right people in real time. The aim of encouraging optimal decision-making at the appropriate moment is to improve efficiency and production further. The critical terms in Industry 4.0, such as the CPS, Internet of Things (IoT), and Digital Twin, are widely used interchangeably in conversations about smart manufacturing. These are essential to Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing because they give users access to real-time operating data of the equipment they represent. Cyber components and physical components make up the two elements of CPS. The main aim of this paper is to brief CPS and its need for Industry 4.0. Embedded Processes and Smart 5C diagrammatically elaborate architecture of CPS for Industry 4.0. Finally, the paper identifies and discusses significant applications of CPS in Industry 4.0. For this paper, we identified and then studied relevant literature on CPS for establishing an Industry 4.0 environment. CPS is integrated into several items, including vehicles and other equipment, to carry out particular functions. CPS can be utilised in any industry, including engineering, manufacturing, transportation, and even health care, because they are all easy to use. CPS network collaborative systems are built for communication. Furthermore, cutting-edge network technologies like cloud solutions are used by CPS.}

To assess the impact of digital transformation on enhancing innovation output, we propose a game model of two organisations investing in digital transformation, analyze the index of enterprise digitalization level with Python tools for text analysis, and employ a fixed effect model. The findings indicate that firm digitalization and the level of regional digital industry innovation can both promote firm innovation. However, the regional digital industry innovation level can have a negative moderating effect on the firm digitalization innovation effect. Furthermore, the impact of firm digitalization on innovation is more visible in digital-related service industries. In other industries, the regional digital industry innovation level has a greater impact on innovation promotion. Due to firms' free-riding tendency in technology adoption, this study shows that the higher the level of digital industrialization in the region where the firm is located, the lower the marginal innovation efficiency of the firm's digital investment. When the level of development of digital industrialization in the region where a firm is located is higher, the "competitive effect" improves the marginal innovation efficiency of firms in adjacent areas, implying that digital industrialization has a spatial spillover effect. The relevant robustness test further verifies the conclusion of the empirical analysis. As a result, the digital industry should be given more attention and financial support.}

Data on land ownership, use, and value in Ghana remain fragmented, and technological systems enabling information services automation, and accessibility to reliable land information remain inefficient. This continues to cause societal problems like; double sales of land, unauthorized changes to land documents, corruption, and bribery. In this study, we argue that the absence of a context-focused guide for technology adaptation is a major factor for failures in previous technology adoption attempts in Ghana’s land sector. We evaluate how a past technology (GELIS) adoption at Accra Lands Commission in Ghana was executed and why it led to unrealized expectations. We relied on elicited expert views followed by content analysis, and validated against a meta-synthesis qualitative review methodology of secondary data. We then extrapolated these results to possible outcomes and trajectories for the adaptation of a new technology like blockchain. Based on blockchain’s interdependent feature, Ghana’s contextual land issues, and the GELIS adoption experience, we develop suggestions covering an extended TOE framework to include socio-cultural elements as a guide for blockchain technology adaptation in Ghana, and other developing land administration systems with similar land issues as Ghana. Policy implications underlining these suggestions are highlighted.}
